        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>Hello everyone, thank you for your time and thank you for this opportunity to share what I could bring to the Multimedia Development and User Experience Librarian Position. One thing I always try to do as a librarian is find ways to empower others and design for different types of accessibility. With that in mind, today's slides are hosted on my website, so you can load them up in your own browser if you'd like. There won't be anything extremely interactive, so please don't scramble to load them out of anxious anticipation or a vague feeling of obligation. They're just available if you'd prefer to read them at your own speed, if you'd appreciate alt-text descriptions of the images, or if you want to follow the links. The URL will stay visible at the bottom left, so you don't have to choose right now. I'll also paste the link in the chat, so you can load them up on your computer later if you'd like. https://www.ryanpatrickrandall.com/talks/bsu.html </aside>

        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>Before: Would this really be a presentation by an instruction librarian if it didn't include goals or learning outcomes at the beginning?  
Goals:  
- I'll briefly share my background  
- and how it influences my current approach to instruction  
- I'll primarily showcase a multimedia learning object, speaking to how I designed and assessed it. Doing this will require giving a bit of context about the instruction need it addresses.  
- Finally, in case you're curious about time, this presentation will last about 30 minutes, and then we'll have 15 minutes for Q&A

          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>I've already spoken with some of you today. And if we haven't met yet, hello! I've been working as the College of Western Idaho Library's Instruction Coordinator since 2015. And in case any recent arrivals to the Treasure Valley don't already know, our team at CWI Library won the ACRL 2019 Excellence in Academic Libraries award for community college libraries. I'm very proud of the work we've done, and excited to have our work recognized by this award. I've been extremely fortunate to work with great colleagues like Lindsay, who also works at Albertsons Library, along with some other faces you might recognize.

          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>As the Instruction coordinator:
- help design and assess our instruction efforts
- plan the instruction content so that it will build coherently throughout each student's experience
- ensure that our multimedia objects are accessible and inclusive; for instance, I took this picture years ago when I was testing whether a dark or light background would work better for slides when we have face-to-face sessions in our instruction lab

As the Outreach Librarian, I go outside the library:
- for instance, I've occasionally volunteered to help the English department with the student outcomes assessment for English 102
- I represent the Library at various campus committees
- in particular, I've participated in the General Education Subcommittee's program assessment for many years
- I've even helped convince the committee to add Information Literacy as a designated outcome of CWI's Gen Ed program

And I aim for lifelong learning, helping students anticipate how what they're doing will be useful in the future.</aside>

- More specifically, I have what educational discourse calls a constructivist approach. Instead of imagining that students show up to campus as empty vessels waiting to be filled with knowledge, a constructivist understands that students bring many tools, lenses, and mental maps with them, then tries to recognize, build from, or refine what students already do.
- As part of that constructivist approach, I create opportunities for students to reflect on what they're doing, the assumptions it might involve, how effective it seems to be, and what other approaches might lead to better outcomes. Encouraging this type of deliberate reflection, sometimes called metacognition, helps students subsequently transfer their learning to a wide range of situations.

          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>Okay! Having given you a sampling of my background and general approach, let's move on to my process for creating and assessing a multimedia learning object. Here is CWI Library's Research Basics badge set. I'll explain how we developed this set, then detail what I revised after we assessed its efficacy. 
- The instruction need this addresses is the baseline knowledge needed to successfully use the library.
- We chose a "flipped" model of instruction, in which students encounter material before an in-class session, then build from that knowledge through practice during the in-class session.
- Prior to creating these badges, we provided formal instruction almost entirely during face-to-face sessions. We worked most frequently with 3 courses: Communications 101, English 102, and our first-semester course, CWI 101. 2 of these courses had small research components—one for a speech and the other for a paper—but none of these courses is a prerequisite for the other. Some students take all three in their first semester, and some take them years apart. This created a frustrating student experience, since we needed to repeat the baseline knowledge for each session. We can't control student enrollment from within the library, but we could control when students encounter these foundational parts of library instruction. By moving the basics outside of class time, we decreased unproductive repetition and made time for increased depth of instruction and active learning.
- The badges have been widely adopted

- SS / WC provides students with tools and strategies to effectively evaluate sources
- AaL aims to overcome library anxiety by having students simply contact the library. This lets students actively practice contacting us, instead of just telling them that they can, in theory. It hopefully also addresses the student experience, particularly frequent at community colleges, of believing that "asking for help" indicates individual weakness rather than showing that you are committed to learning.

          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
- Analysis: As I've described before, our main problem was how to get students to build foundational library skills without experiencing it as frustratingly unproductive repetition
- Design: We chose a flipped model with a range of multimedia content followed by in-class activities that would address the assignments of different courses, as well as elements of the ACRL Framework; For instance, with the Communications class, we worked through the information lifecycle and selecting popular sources for a speech, and with the English class, we worked through searching for articles and understanding scholarly peer-review.
- Development: We briefly considered platforms like Mozilla's "Open Badges" project, but ultimately decided on Blackboard for likelihood of professor adoption, ease of use, and portability within our college.
- Implementation: We asked some of our library student workers for feedback on prototypes. In particular, we asked them to take the quizzes to make sure that the questions were phrased appropriately.
- Evaluation: At the moment, formative evaluation only happens within the badges to the extent that a student reflects on their own learning as we pose questions to them. Learning is measured by the quiz at the end. This is partially due to technological constraints of Blackboard, and partially due to our initial emphasis on having in-class activities. In the future, I'd hope to use H5P interactive elements for formative assessment.</aside>
