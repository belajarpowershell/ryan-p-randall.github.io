					<aside class="notes">Hi everyone, my name is Ryan Randall. I've made this presentation so that you can follow along with it in your own browser rather than just having to watch up here. Even if you don't want to navigate it yourself, I've put some useful links in there, so please go ahead and pull it up on your own computer now. *RIGHT*</aside>

					<h2>Hello!</h2>
					<h3>I'm Ryan Randall, from the library!</h3>
					<br />
					<br />
					<p>I'm here to help you prepare for your analysis and reflection papers.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						I'm an MLS student at Indiana University in Bloomington, with a background in English literature and cultural studies. I'm excited to help you hone research skills that will work for papers in this class and beyond. In particular, we'll be getting ready for your analysis and reflection papers today. *RIGHT*
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Analysis Paper</h3>
					<p>In the next 35 minutes, we will work on:</p>
						<ol>
						<li class="fragment">Evaluating appropriate secondary sources</li>
						<li class="fragment">Learning useful places to find them</li>
						<li class="fragment">Reviewing APA citation components</li>
						</ol>
					<aside class="notes">
					Over the last few class sessions your professor has told you the guidelines for the Analysis paper, its evaluation criteria, and discussed APA format. Hopefully you now have some idea of the topic you'd like to research and analyze. <br /> But it's fine if you don't! I'm here to help you with the research process, which is supposed to help you generate ideas. We'll discuss *RIGHT* evaluating appropriate secondary sources, *RIGHT* useful places to find them, *RIGHT* and the things you'll need to keep track of for APA citation format.*RIGHT* 	
					</aside>

					<h3>Analysis Paper</h3>
					<p>"…analyze a recent case having to do with digital media ethics and apply stasis theory to analyze the case."</p>
					<p class="fragment">Stasis theory</p>
						<ol>
						<li class="fragment">conjectural issue—facts of the case</li>
						<li class="fragment">definitive issue—definition of relevant terms</li>
						<li class="fragment">qualitative issue—nature of the act</li>
						<li class="fragment">translative issue—jurisdiction of the court</li>
						</ol>
					<p class="fragment"><small>Hatch (1993). "Classical Stasis Theory and the Analysis of Public Policy."</small></p>
					<aside class="notes">
					As we will discuss further, what makes a source "appropriate" is context-specific, so let's look a bit more at your assignment in detail. You are supposed to "……analyze a recent case having to do with digital media ethics and apply stasis theory to analyze the case" *SLIDE*. Since you are looking to analyze this via statis theory, you're looking for secondary sources that establish facts. What are some good types of sources for facts about recent events?  	
					</aside>

					<h3>Reflection Paper</h3>
						<p>"What have I learned from this process?"</p>
						<p class="fragment current-visible"><img data-src="http://media.giphy.com/media/A5ugHVbuFL3uo/giphy.gif" width="60%"</p>
					<aside class="notes">
					Toward the end of this course you'll be writing a reflection paper, a useful place to think about what you've learned over the course and consolidate that into words. Not only will taking notes during your research process help you make sense of what you're doing in the middle of what can feel like a very messy or even frustrating process… *RIGHT*…HOMER!…*RIGHT*   
					</aside>
					</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Reflection Essay</h3>
						<p>"Research can be a messy but rewarding process"</p>
						<p class="fragment current-visible"><img data-src="http://media.giphy.com/media/5xtDarIkNh9LFpOcTjG/giphy.gif" width="70%"></p>
					<aside class="notes">
					…but you can also feel confident that you'll be able to retain what you've learned for future classes. *RIGHT*…Chef!… *RIGHT* If you keep track of your sources, you'll not only be able to cite them more easily for the analysis paper, but you can also write about how your thoughts on your topic changed or refined through the process of grappling with what you find through your research. To help you succeed, my main goal for today is that by the end of this session, you'll have emailed yourself at least one secondary source that could be useful for your paper.

					<h3>Evaluating appropriate secondary sources</h3>
					<p>Secondary sources are:</p>
						<ul>
						<li class="fragment">removed from the event by degrees of time or involvement</li>
						<li class="fragment">often summarizing or analyzing</li>
						<li class="fragment">often journalistic or historical</li>
						</ul>
					<img data-src="./images/downarrow.png" style="border:none; box-shadow:none; width:50px; margin-top:100px;">	
					<aside class="notes">Let's think about secondary sources for a moment. What are they, and why would we want to use them for an ethics analysis paper? Can anyone remind me of what makes a secondary source different from a primary source? Do they have a different type of authority than primary sources? <br /> *RIGHT* They're separated from the "primary" event, either by time, or participation, or both. *RIGHT* They often do the work of summary or analysis. *RIGHT* They're also often written with journalistic or historical tone.</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
					<h3>Evaluating with "CAARP" test</h3>
						<ul> 
						<li class="fragment"><i>Currency</i>, or when—timeliness of information</li>
						<li class="fragment"><i>Authority</i>, or who—expertise of author</li>
						<li class="fragment"><i>Accuracy</i>, or how—support for claims with references</li>
						<li class="fragment"><i>Relevance</i>, or why for your essay—suitability of approach and language</li>
						<li class="fragment"><i>Purpose</i>, or why written at all—original reason for publication</li>
						</ul>

					<aside class="notes">Sarah Blakeslee, a librarian at California State University, Chico introduced a useful rubric for evaluating sources. She initially went with the acronymn "CRAAP," but it's memorable in any order. Here it is *DOWN x5* The "timeliness" of information can vary depending on what type of information you're discussing. For instance, Blakeslee wrote about this mnemonic in 2004, but the principles she discusses are remain timely. 2004 might be very out of date for other topics, though. Can you think of something written in 2004 that would almost certainly be outdated by now? Just as a random technology example, iPhones weren't introuced until 2007! In other words, some of these evaluation criteria are context-specific. There often isn't a simple yes or no answer; they're more like guidelines. *DOWN*</aside>

					<h3>Useful places to find secondary sources</h3>
					<p class="fragment">That's right, Miami University Libraries!</p>  
					<p class="fragment">More specifically, in databases.</p> 
					<br /> 
					<p class="fragment">Unlike Google, DuckDuckGo, or other open internet searches, databases are collections of items that fit certain selection criteria. Library databases are usually articles organized by subject.</p>
					<img data-src="./images/downarrow.png" style="border:none; box-shadow:none; width:50px; margin-top:100px;">	
					<aside class="notes">So now that we have a good idea of how to recognize appropriate sources, what are some handy places to look? Can you suggest places that might already have chosen timely, authoritative, accurate, and not self-serving information? *DOWN x2* This makes them less overwhelming and often more likely to bring back results that are appropriate for essays. Have you used any kind of database before?</aside>	
					</section>
					<section>
					<h3>Databases on the Libraries homepage</h3>
					<img data-src="./images/databasesMULskitch.png" style="border:none; box-shadow:none; width:80%;"> <br />
					<img data-src="./images/downarrow.png" style="border:none; box-shadow:none; width:50px; margin-top:100px;">
					<aside class="notes">Here's where databases live on the main Libraries homepage. Let's go ahead and navigate to one called LexisNexis, which is the one I recommend you start with for your Ethics Analysis paper.</aside>	
					</section>
					<section>
					<h3>Let's go to "LexisNexis News"</h3>
					<p><a href="http://www.lib.miamioh.edu/" target="blank">www.lib.miamioh.edu</a></p>
					<img data-src="./images/downarrow.png" style="border:none; box-shadow:none; width:50px; margin-top:100px;">
					<aside class="notes">Let's go to "LexisNexis News" from the library homepage. Have you heard of open access? What does that mean? Most of the library's databases are not open access, which means that you couldn't access a lot of what is in these from a Google search. It Miami University librarians have chosen which ones to pay for so researchers can access their contents. If you're not on campus, you'll probably have to log in with your user name and password. You can see that there are a lot of them here, each with a brief description to let you know what it addresses best. You have access to these while you're a student, so I'd suggest taking 15 minutes sometime in the next few days to just check out what is here. It'll be handy if you remember it for another class.</aside>

					<section>
					<h3>Let's get our bearings with LexisNexis</h3>
					<p>Have you opened <a href="http://www.lib.miamioh.edu/databases/L" target="blank">LexisNexis News</a> and tried out searching, then worked on refining the results?<br /><br />If you <em>haven't</em>, you're at the wrong slide! <br />If you <em>have</em>, congratuations! We're that much closer to a successful analysis paper.<br /> <br />Also, if you have any further questions, please go ahead and ask now.</p>
					<img data-src="./images/downarrow.png" style="border:none; box-shadow:none; width:50px; margin-top:100px;">
					<aside class="notes">Search terms: gamergate, show location. Search: apology, company, scandal, Target, ethics, Uber. Sending this won't count toward your grade! I just will rest easier knowing that you've been able to find things that you think are appropriate for your topics.</aside>	
					</section>

					<section>
					<h3>From the Database to Your Inbox</h3>
					<br />
					<p>Go ahead and take a minute to email the resources that you've found to yourself.</p>
					<p>Please send me a copy as well (<a href="mailto:ryrandal@indiana.edu">ryrandal@indiana.edu</a>) so I can have an idea of what you're working on in case you want to schedule a reference appointment with me later.</p>

					<h3>Databases and other Resources by Subject</h3>
					<img data-src="./images/subjectcourseguidesMULskitch.png" style="border:none; box-shadow:none; width:80%;"> <br />
					<img data-src="./images/rightarrow.png" style="border:none; box-shadow:none; width:50px; margin-top:100px;">
					<aside class="notes">I'm recommending LexisNexis for this assignment because you're looking to analyze ethical quandries, and accounts of those will show up most quickly in journalistic resources. But what if you don't know which databases exist, or which ones are appropriate for different subjects? For future reference, if you're looking for databases, this pane of the library home page is a great place to start. Different subject librarians have already selected different resources—databases, journals, and other things—that they recommend for whatever subject they've listed them under.</aside>

					<h3>APA citation format</h3>
					<p>If you remember nothing else about APA citation, remember this link to the <a href="http://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/c.php?g=22176" target="_blank">Miami University Libraries APA Citation Style Guide</a>. It details how to do most of the types of citation you'll need, both for in-text citation and for the bibliography, which is called the "References" section in APA style.</p>

					<h3>Evaluating appropriate secondary sources</h3>
					<p>You'll want to keep track of:

					<h3>APA citation format</h3>
					<p>Databases almost always let you email yourself the items you find, which means that you'll have an easier time keeping track of the elements you need to cite it. <br /> <br /> LexisNexis News also shows these elements on the page view.

					<h3>APA citation format</h3>
					<p>Check out the links at <a href="http://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/citation">King Library's own page on citation styles</a> for more information. The <a href="http://proxy.lib.muohio.edu/loggedin/APAguidetoelectronicrefs.pdf">guide to citing electronic references</a> might prove especially useful for resources you'll come across for Digital Ethics.</p>
					<p>I also suggest the <a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/">OWL at Purdue</a> for detailed descriptions of both in-text and final citations in APA format.</p>
