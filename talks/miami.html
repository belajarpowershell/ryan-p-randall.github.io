					<h2>Hello!</h2>
					<h3>I'm Ryan Randall, from the library!</h3>
					<br />
					<br />
					<p>I'm here to help you prepare for your analysis and reflection papers.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						My name is Ryan Randall. I'm an MLS student at IU Bloomington with a background in English literature and cultural studies. I'm excited to help you hone research skills that will work for papers in this class and beyond.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>In the next 35 minutes, we will work on:</h3>
						<ol>
						<li class="fragment">Evaluating appropriate secondary sources</li>
						<li class="fragment">Learning useful places to find them</li>
						<li class="fragment">Reviewing APA citation format</li>
						</ol>
					<aside class="notes">
					Over the last few class sessions your professor has told you the guidelines for the Ethics Analysis paper, its evaluation criteria, and discussed APA format. Hopefully you now have some idea of the topic you'd like to research and analyze. But it's fine if you don't! I'm here to help you with the research process, which is supposed to help you generate ideas. We'll discuss *RIGHT* evaluating appropriate secondary sources, *RIGHT* useful places to find them, *RIGHT* and the things you'll need to keep track of for APA citation format. 	
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Reflection Essay</h3>
						<p>"What have I learned from this process?"</p>
						<p class="fragment current-visible"><img data-src="http://media.giphy.com/media/A5ugHVbuFL3uo/giphy.gif" width="60%"</p>
					<aside class="notes">
					Toward the end of this course you'll be writing a reflection paper, a useful place to think about what you've learned over the course and put into words. Not only will taking notes during your research process help you make sense of what you're doing in the middle of what can feel very messy or even frustrating. *RIGHT*…HOMER!…*RIGHT*

					<aside class="notes">
					…but you can also feel confident that you'll be able to retain what you've learned for future classes. *RIGHT*…Chef!… *RIGHT* To help you succeed, my main goal for today is that by the end of this session, you'll have emailed yourself at least one secondary source that could be useful for your paper.

					<h3>Evaluating appropriate secondary sources</h3>
					<p>Secondary sources are:</p>
						<ul>
						<li class="fragment">removed from the event by degrees of time or involvement</li>
						<li class="fragment">often summarizing or analyzing</li>
						<li class="fragment">often journalistic or historical</li>
						</ul>
					<img data-src="./images/downarrow.png" style="border:none; box-shadow:none; width:50px; margin-top:100px;">	
					<aside class="notes">Let's think about secondary sources for a moment. What are they, and why would we want to use them for an ethics analysis paper? Can anyone remind me of what makes a secondary source different from a primary source? Do they have a different type of authority than primary sources? They're separated from the "primary" event, either by time, or participation, or both. They often do the work of summary or analysis. They're also often written with journalistic or historical tone.</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
					<h3>Evaluating with "CAARP" test</h3>
						<ul> 
						<li class="fragment"><i>Currency</i>, or when—timeliness of information</li>
						<li class="fragment"><i>Authority</i>, or who—expertise of author</li>
						<li class="fragment"><i>Accuracy</i>, or how—support for claims with references</li>
						<li class="fragment"><i>Relevance</i>, or why for your essay—suitability of approach and language</li>
						<li class="fragment"><i>Purpose</i>, or why written at all—original reason for publication</li>
						</ul>
					<p>	
					<img data-src="./images/downarrow.png" style="border:none; box-shadow:none; width:50px; margin-top:100px;"></p>
					<aside class="notes">Sarah Blakeslee, a librarian at California State University, Chico introduced this rubric with the acronymn "CRAAP," but it's memorable in any order. The "timeliness" of information can vary depending on what type of information you're discussing. For instance, Blakeslee wrote about this acronym in 2004, but the principles she discusses are still timely. But can you think of something written in 2004 that would almost certainly be outdated by now? Just as a random technology example, iPhones weren't introuced until 2007!</aside>

					<p>If you'd like to return to this later, here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jGl-Hh_znQ" target="_blank">short but useful video from Wichita State University Libraries</a> that discusses this evaluation strategy in more detail.</p>

				<!-- Learning useful places to find them (library databases) -->  

				<section>
					<section>
					<h3>Useful places to find secondary sources</h3>
					<p class="fragment">That's right, King Library!</p>  
					<p class="fragment">More specifically, in databases.</p> 
					<br /> 
					<p class="fragment">Unlike Google, DuckDuckGo, or other open internet searches, databases are collections of items that fit particular criteria. This makes them less overwhelming and often more likely to bring back results that are appropriate for essays.</p>
					<img data-src="./images/downarrow.png" style="border:none; box-shadow:none; width:50px; margin-top:100px;">	
					<aside class="notes">So now that we have a good idea of how to recognize appropriate sources, what are some good places to look? Can you suggest places that might already have chosen timely, authoritative, accurate, and not self-serving information? Have you used any databases before?</aside>	
					</section>
					<section>
					<h3>From the Database to Your Inbox</h3>
					<br />
					<p>Go ahead and take a minute to email the resources that you've found to yourself.</p>
					<p>Please send me a copy as well (<a href="mailto:ryrandal@indiana.edu">ryrandal@indiana.edu</a>)so I can have an idea of what you're working on in case you want to schedule a reference appointment with me later.</p>
					<img data-src="./images/downarrow.png" style="border:none; box-shadow:none; width:50px; margin-top:100px;">
					<aside class="notes">Sending this won't count toward your grade! I just will rest easier knowing that you've been able to find things that you think are appropriate for your topics.</aside>	
					</section>
					<section>
					<h3>Databases on the Libraries homepage</h3>
					<img data-src="./images/databasesMULskitch.png" style="border:none; box-shadow:none; width:80%;"> <br />
					<img data-src="./images/downarrow.png" style="border:none; box-shadow:none; width:50px; margin-top:100px;">
					<aside class="notes">Have you heard of open access? What does that mean? Most of the library's databases are not open access, which means that Miami University librarians have chosen which ones to pay for so researchers can access their contents. If you're not on campus, you'll probably have to log in with your user name and password.</aside>

					<section>
					<h3>Useful places to find secondary sources</h3>
					<p>{screencaps of LexisNexis &amp; link to it at Miami U}</p>
					<img data-src="./images/downarrow.png" style="border:none; box-shadow:none; width:50px; margin-top:100px;">	
					<aside class="notes"></aside>	
					</section>
					<section>
					<h3>Databases and other Resources by Subject</h3>
					<img data-src="./images/subjectcourseguidesMULskitch.png" style="border:none; box-shadow:none; width:80%;"> <br />
					<img data-src="./images/downarrow.png" style="border:none; box-shadow:none; width:50px; margin-top:100px;">
					<aside class="notes">I'm recommending LexisNexis for this assignment because you're looking to analyze ethical quandries, and most accounts of those will show up in journalistic resources. But what if you don't know which databases exist, or which ones are appropriate for different subjects? For future reference, if you're looking for databases, this pane of the library home page is a great place to start. Different subject librarians have already selected different resources—databases, journals, and other things—that they recommend for whatever subject they've listed them under.</aside>

					<section>
					<h3>APA citation format</h3>
					<p>If you remember nothing else about APA citation, remember this link to the <a href="http://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/c.php?g=22176" target="_blank">Miami University Libraries APA Citation Style Guide</a>. It shows how to do most of the types of citation you'll need, both for in-text citation and for the bibliography, which is called the "References" section.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><img data-src="./images/downarrow.png" style="border:none; box-shadow:none; width:50px; margin-top:100px;"></p>	
					<aside class="notes"></aside>	
					</section>
					<section>
					<h3>Evaluating appropriate secondary sources</h3>
					<p>You'll want to keep track of:
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Author's Name</li>
						<li class="fragment">Title of author's work (the whole title!)</li>
						<li class="fragment">Publication's Title</li>
						<li class="fragment">Publication's Location</li>
						<li class="fragment">Publication Date</li>
						<li class="fragment">Date you accessed any online materials (they can disappear!)</li>
						<li class="fragment">Page numbers, URLs, or DOIs (DOIs are basically fancier URLs)</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>APA citation format</h3>
					<p>Databases almost always let you email yourself the items you find, which means that you'll have an easier time keeping track of the elements you need to cite it.

					<h3>APA citation format</h3>
					<p>Check out the links at <a href="http://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/citation">King Library's own page on citation styles</a> for more information. The <a href="http://proxy.lib.muohio.edu/loggedin/APAguidetoelectronicrefs.pdf">guide to citing electronic references</a> might prove especially useful for resources you'll come across for Digital Ethics.</p>
					<p>I also suggest the <a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/">OWL at Purdue</a> for detailed descriptions of both in-text and final citations in APA format.</p>
