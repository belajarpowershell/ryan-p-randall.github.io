Although I appreciate everything about this paper, I particularly return to Riggs & Linder's ideas of "an architecture of engagement in the online classroom" and "re-imagining discussion boards as interactive spaces."  

If you do any sort of online instruction—and especially if you're skeptical about it—I highly recommend you reading this paper.
