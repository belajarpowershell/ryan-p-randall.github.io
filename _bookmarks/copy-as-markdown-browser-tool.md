I can't remember where I first encountered Copy as Markdown, but it's long been one of my favorite small tech tools. I use it multiple times a week—if not multiple times **a day**—to make a list of all my browser tabs open in a given window.  

For me, this is especially useful when I've gone down a rabbit hole related to a particular topic and I want to switch mental gears without taking the time to comb through each one individually, but I also don't want to just lose everything in that line of thought. In this case, I'll often find or make a note related to that line of thought, then paste the list of links there.  

I also have quarterly "links today" notes where I'll copy and paste things when I just need to reset my mental "context." Then when I need to find a useful link later, I'll use whatever "find in file"-style command is in the relevant text editor (like Obsidian or VS Code) to find terms that might be in the link title or link URL.  

(Why quarterly? I used to just have a single list per year, but I've found that these files eventually grow so long that they'll bog down my text editors. Quarterly seems an appropriate "chunk" both for my own mental recall/content and for the text tools I use most.)  

I find this way of recall far more reliable than relying on browser history alone. It helps put links usefully back in some sort of original context, rather than atomizing each link entirely.
