  Glad to hear the #critlib chat got you writing more. I find I've been doing
  more writing my hand, digging deeper than I had been last year. Spelling out
  some of my assumptions helps me to see what is and is not useful, and to think
  through other possibilities. But I rarely go back to previous entries, other
  than skimming each journal as I complete it. Do you find that tagging
  facilities returning to or building on what you've written already?
