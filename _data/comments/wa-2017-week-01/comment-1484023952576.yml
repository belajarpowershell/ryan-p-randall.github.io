message: "Hi Lisa—I really appreciate the #critlib chat you hosted! It definitely helped me get back into writing journal entires, rather than just having keeping a monthly file with daily to-do lists. So thanks again!   \r\n\r\nTagging and search are the main reasons I now do my journaling & other note-taking electronically. Even when I used to do a lot of my writing in physical notebooks I'd keep with me, I'd often put a few keywords at the top of a page, since that would help me find things later much more easily. Now that I think about it, maybe that keywords-on-paper practice is because one of my middle school teachers had us do [Cornell notes](http://lsc.cornell.edu/study-skills/cornell-note-taking-system/) for a while?   \r\n\r\nAnyways, since I already did that in my pocket notebooks, making text files with easy search or tagging tools feels like an extension of what I'd do on paper—plus I don't have to fret that I'll look all my ideas if I wander away from those bound pieces of paper. (I have my text files synced to Dropbox, so I don't have that anxiety, and I can edit or refer to them on my phone. Since I already enthused about all this in my post for the chat you lead, I won't geek out about it again any further. \uD83E\uDD13 )   \r\n\r\nThese \"Weekly Assemblage\" posts are about as close as I'll get to a public journal, and I started doing them in part so that I'd have a way to search by tag. If you'd want to try tagging text files yourself, I used [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com) briefly years ago and remember it having tags. Even if you don't find a program that has specific tag functionality,  a [pretty established syntax](https://guide.taskpaper.com/getting-started/) for making tags in text files is to add a \"@\" to the front of the word, so it'll look like @tag or @pedagogy. The Taskpaper syntax is what gave me the idea for the \"0-\" I used in my electronic journal; sadly Jekyll really restricts the punctuation you can use for tags, so \"0-\" seems like the next best thing.   \r\n\r\nI think maybe the reason I like tagging so much is because I've always had a porous memory & a propensity for getting distracted. Even though I call my writing a \"journal,\" it's just as much reading notes, jottings of cool things I write down to allow myself to research later instead of being distracted by in the moment, or a [commonplace book](http://www.dirgemag.com/bullet-journals-commonplace-books/). My notebooks have always been a jumble of all those things. Rarely, I will write mostly to articulate my thoughts, and that kind of writing-to-think sounds a lot like what you do with your journals. Maybe we each develop the practices that we need?"
