Currently working as the Government Information Reference Assistant in the [Government Information, Maps, and Microform Services Department](http://www.libraries.iub.edu/index.php?pageId=285) of IU Bloomington's [Herman B Wells Library](http://www.libraries.iub.edu/index.php?pageId=89), I'm excited to provide critical information literacy instruction as I help patrons discover and access resources at the combination reference/circulation desk. Last year I worked as the Maps Graduate Assistant in the same department, carefully scanning maps, determining appropriate metadata, and making these historical resources available online through the [Indiana Historical Maps Digital Collection](http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/images/splash.htm?scope=images/VAC3073).  

Outside of that department, I’m working as a library Instruction Assistant and helping the Assessment Librarian conduct ethnographic studies of library patrons. In the past, I’ve taught Freshman writing, American Studies, and Film/Media courses. I have also been a college writing tutor for undergraduate and graduate students.  

Along the way, I've picked up an MA in [English from the University of California, Riverside](http://english.ucr.edu/) and an MA in [Visual and Cultural Studies from the University of Rochester](http://www.rochester.edu/college/vcs/). As a student in IU Bloomington’s [MLS program](http://ils.indiana.edu/) I am refining my critical information literacy instruction skills, learning digital humanities techniques, and building a librarianship based on critical praxis.
