I've been wanting to write about some ways that my smartwatch has helped me deal with the fact that I perceive time differently than most neurotypical people.  

## Timers  

I use the timer function often—especially when I'm doing any kind of presentation, instruction, or other public speaking. Timers are actually one of the main reasons I initially saved up for my smartwatch. I'd previously used my phone as a timer, only to be occasionally told by students and instructors that they found my "checking my phone" during instruction sessions distracting.[^ptd]  

[^ptd]: Yes, there are more levels to that than I care to go into here.  

The two most obvious benefits of a smartwatch timer:
1. it can silently inform you when your timer is up  
2. it uses the cultural assumption that if you glance at an electronic device on your wrist, you're checking about time  

### Timer Apps

Here are the timer apps I use the most:  

1. Apple's built-in timer is great and displays well in many different faces  
2. [Due](https://www.dueapp.com) lets you have multiple timers simultaneously.  
  - For instance, you can set a 2 hour timer in Due to remind you of when you need to start making dinner. Then simultaneously you can set a 25 minute timer in Due to keep track of a pomodoro burst of work/focus. On days when you're really scattered, you can even set smaller simultaneous 5 or 10 minute timers to help remind you to stay on task.  
  - Due also can sync between your watch, phone, and computer. Super handy in case you're not always at your computer!
3. [Time Timer](https://www.timetimer.com/collections/applications) is one that I've just started using in the last few days. It displays time "backwards," by highlighting the time _remaining_ rather than the time _elapsed_. The same company makes a range of physical timers as well. This app version is currently free during the pandemic. I tend to get up and walk around when I'm thinking. Sometimes it's to get the wiggles out, sometimes because I truly get distracted, and sometimes because I go look through my bookshelves trying to find a book related to an idea I just had. So for me, a timer strapped to my wrist feels far lot more reliable than a physical one.  

## Calendars & Time  

Here are some things I've found about setting up the basic look of the watch, outside of timers or other functions.  

### Built-in Watch Features  
  - putting the date prominently with one of the large complications  
  - using the "World Clock" to display digital time in analog faces  

### Other Apps  

- [watchsmith](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/watchsmith/id1483088503#?platform=appleWatch)'s week & geometry elements  
  - "Week 32" week number complication  
  - Geometric representation of the year, highlight today's dot out of 365 dots in 12 rows… i.e. a geometric representation of the day, which lets me perceive the relative proportions of elapsed and remaining time way better than just looking at the representation "August 27" ever could  
- upcoming calendar events in complications
