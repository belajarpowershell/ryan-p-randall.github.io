Here are some intriguing snippets about "information" I've found.  

## Purdon, _Modernist Informatics_  

> _Modernist Informatics_ explores the premise that informatics begins not with digitization but rather with the development of new information controls in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century government sysstems. Informatics might then be understood as _the government of information_, allowing that phrase its full measure of ambiguity in order to call to mind the way information has emerged as both the basis of modern political power and one of its primary objects of attention and control.
