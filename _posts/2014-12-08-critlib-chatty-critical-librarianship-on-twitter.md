Here's a [post I wrote for Hack Libary School](http://hacklibschool.wordpress.com/2014/12/08/critlib-chatty-critical-librarianship-on-twitter/) on critical librarianship and the #critlib chats on Twitter. I also discuss student-led interests groups, metacognition, and Bloom's Taxonomy of educational objectives. There's even a brief bibliography of anthologies to check out for more on critical librarianship.
