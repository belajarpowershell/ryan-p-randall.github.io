Today—the day after I finished up a "16 weeks condensed into 4" Spanish class—I happened to read some folks on Mastodon talking about [light themes](https://social.pixie.town/@joepie91/110526984317454201) on websites.  

I've been wanting to add one to my site for years, my brain apparently wanted a project I could reasonably accomplish in a day, and I vaguely remebered having seen other [Minimal Mistakes theme users discussing how to implement this](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/discussions/2033#discussioncomment-257421).  

Thus far today I've managed to have my Jekyll-based site correctly generate two different themes: the one I've been using for years and another one that's basically the default theme with a couple of colors switched out. That's a success!  

It also puts down foundation for adding a toggle. That's successfully building toward a future success!  

There are going to be some surprises along the way to a fully-featured light mode, such as noticing **and also fixing** the fact that the Bigfoot pop-up colors aren't really legible at the moment. I'll need to figure out how many of these things I can avoid hard-coding in the future. But it's nice to finally work on it, even if doing so was somewhat of a surprise today.
