Excerpts from _Naming What We Know: Threshold Concepts of Writing Studies_:  

> What do threshold concepts offer composition studies? At first glance, they may seem like a kind of canon, a list of the defining key terms of the discipline, with an explicit emphasis on definition and the implication of dogma. At a second glance, and according to all the writers in part 2 of _Naming_, they seem much more contingent—presented here not as canonical statement, but rather as articulation of shared beliefs providing multiple ways of helping us name what we know and how we can use what we know in the service of writing. That use value, as described in the chapters, takes various forms. In one version, threshold concepts function as boundary objects, allowing us to toggle between the beliefs of the discipline and those of individual institutions; in another version, they function as a heuristic or portal for planning; in yet another version, they seem a set of propositions that can be put into dialogue with threshold concepts from a subdiscipline or from a different discipline for a richly layered map of a given phenomenon. (xix)  

This conception of threshold concepts, their durability, and their use cases seems strikingly different from the understanding that circulated around their use in the _Framework._ Although this account of threshold concepts harmonizes with my understanding of the _Framework_, it seems weird that the descriptions of threshold concepts in library work do not seem to emphasize this pliability. Instead, the _Framework_ seems to say that the concepts remain the same, with only their application varying according to context (of institution, of discipline, of program, of class, etc.). It's very different to instead say that the concepts themselves function more as strategic polemicism (yes, that's a nod to strategic essentialism), a maneuver for crystalizing _an understanding_ or _a facet_ of writing/composition, rather than an obdurate fact, theory, or falsifiable claim that should be subjected to rigorous testing before being taken up in a social sciences-style practice of knowing.
