A more thorough beginning to this post would talk at length about _why_ one might prefer to use plain text files over proprietary formats like `.doc` or `.docx` or over word processor files like the non-proprietary [`.odf`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument) you can use with [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org) or [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org). Those last two are laudable examples of non-proprietary word processors, and they're great to be familiar with if you want to help patrons or students use tools they can afford (i.e. free) that remain interoperable with office suites that cost lots of money.   

But I'm not talking about programs that do complicated things that interweave formatting with textâ€”that's the domain of word processors. Here, I'm talking about programs that save into (not just export into) simple `.txt` files.   

Here's a few quick, interrelated reasons why you might prefer text files:  

- they're the most easily opened files  
- they're (therefore) the closest to future-proof you can get   
- they're some of the smallest in terms of file size   
- they're easily used across multiple platforms (different operating systems, both for computers and phone/devices; different individual machines; etc.)  

Of course, some of those _why_ reasons veer into, or at least strongly imply, _how_ reasons. This post will mostly focus on how I've come to use plain text files and which tools I'd recommend if you're interesting in doing the same.   

To begin with, you'll want a text editor. If you don't already have a favorite, I'd recommend the free, open source [Atom text editor](https://atom.io), which lets you extend its capabilities with all sorts of features. You install these new features as [packages](https://atom.io/docs/v1.5.3/using-atom-atom-packages). Some packages called themes use colors to remind you of the syntax of whatever you're writing. 

For instance, if you're writing an html file with a link, you can use a theme that will show you which portion of the code refers to the displayed text and which is the link path:
