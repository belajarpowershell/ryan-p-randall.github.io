This week I've been getting ready to move to Boise, ID to take a Librarian (Instruction & Outreach) position at the [College of Western Idaho](https://cwidaho.cc/)â€”I couldn't be happier!   

Among many other things, this meant that I had to finish a couple of books I was reading online via Indiana University's library system. So I'll briefly write up my thoughts on those, then link to a couple of other important events I learned about this week.
