Here's a [post I wrote for Hack Library School](http://hacklibraryschool.com/2015/01/20/how-do-you-take-notes/) discussing Markdown and the Bullet Journal system for note-taking. Markdown is a simplified way of writing html, and happens to also be what I use when writing this site through [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). [Bullet Journals](http://bulletjournal.com/) are a system not for classroom or lecture note-taking, but rather for everyday notes about actions, ideas, or projects.   

An aside on Markdown not in that Hack Library School article: Sometime I plan to write a few posts on this blog about how I made this site with Jekyll and GitHub Pages, both of which use Markdown. I actually write all the notes that I type in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format (or a variant) because I prefer plain text files and being able to output from there to all sorts of different presentation formats like .docx, .pdf, or .rtf. Oddly enough, I starting using it because earlier versions of iOS didn't have a way of writing notes that allowed for formatted text, so Markdown started taking off among people who had iPhones but wanted to write links (or *italics* for academic citations). I'm glad I started using Markdown, even if I do so because of technical limitations, because I think it's a highly useful way not just for writing for the web but also for taking notes and writing in the most lightweight, future-proof format possible.
