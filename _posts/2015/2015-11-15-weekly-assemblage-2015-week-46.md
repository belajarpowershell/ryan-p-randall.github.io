# Reads of the Week!   

- ["Undigesting Deleuze" by Brian Massumi](https://lareviewofbooks.org/essay/undigesting-deleuze/), accessible at LA Review of Books  
- ["The Idea of a Writing Center" by Stephen M. North](http://www.worldcat.org/title/the-idea-of-a-writing-center/oclc/425476890) in _College English_ v46 n5 p433-46 Sep 1984    

This has been a week of reading things that make me think about librarianship in new ways. The first regards what image of thought we might recognize in libraries or library work ("library work" here meaning actions of assembling, maintaining, and/or using libraries in multiple, expansive modes): "speculative pragmatism" as Massumi describes it sounds much more apt to encourage the sort of vibrant, generative, transformative library use I hope for than a librarianship that primarily seeks stasis or generalities in its subjects. The second offers a way of thinking about how the educational possibilities libraries & librarians can offer their users—I'm explicitly including public libraries here!—differ from other areas for education.   

## "Undigesting Deleuze"   

Massumi has translated, explicated, & extended much of Deleuze's work for English speakers, which helps explain how he can distill so much into this brief summary of Deleuze's work and its reception by the Anglophone academy. In addition to encapsulating a lot of what Deleuze's writing forwards about things as processes of becoming, my reading of this short piece sees it offering excellent provocations for librarianship.   

The first provocation would be the championing of singularities over generalities and how this would trouble classification systems—but I'll just leave that alone for the night. I'm most interested in another, second potential within the piece, the "speculative pragmatism" Massumi terms Deleuze's approach. When reading about critical librarianship, information literacy instruction, or reference, I've often come across passages that resonate with Massumi's words in the second-to-last paragraph, the one that conveys what he thinks matters about speculative pragmatism's ethics of engagement:    

> To prove equal to the import, to follow the trail of the mattering-on, to honor the potential of the process, it is necessary to participate with great pragmatic and speculative care — and just as much artfulness. There is by the nature of this activity a political element to it. The art of mutual inclusion, with care: that could stand as the very definition of the political.   

Librarianship as profession that is simultaneously caring, pragmatic, and deeply political? One that attends to the tendencies and specifics of people or works, in hopes of seeing how they transform? An image of information professionals who proceed not by authoritarian detachment or a priori assumptions, but by participation in processes of research & evaluation? _Yes_. I certainly will entertain this possibility & aim to articulate it further.
