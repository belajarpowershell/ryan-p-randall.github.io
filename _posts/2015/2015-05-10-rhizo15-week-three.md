This post is for [Week Three](http://rhizomatic.net/2015/04/29/week-3-the-myth-of-content/) of [#rhizo15](http://rhizomatic.net/): "The Myth of Content".  
{: .notice}  

This week, Dave asks:

I'd say that in order to avoid massively reifying "content," the healthiest approach is to assume that content is always just what a particular system can capture.
