## &#035;critlib chat on Scientific Objectivity  

On Tuesday, 2015-10-06, Rory Litwin of Library Juice Press moderated a [#critlib Twitter chat on neutrality and objectivity in scientific information](http://critlib.org/neutrality-and-objectivity-in-scientific-information/). Referencing the [“Scientific Objectivity” article by Julian Reiss and Jan Sprenger](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-objectivity/) from the excellent, open-access Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, this chat dealt with the tension between respecting patron agency and what information most medical professionals recognize as sound. Using anti-vaccination as a thought experiment, we discussed ways to negotate this tension.  

At the moment no one has made a Storify of the chat, but I'll update this if one becomes available.
