# Reads this Week   

## Bob Schoofs, "The Flow of Learning: It's Not Just in the Classroom"   

["The Flow of Learning: It's Not Just in the Classroom](http://commons.emich.edu/loexquarterly/vol40/iss3/)   

Here Schoofs discusses the actions of learning as a "flow" that spreads across campus & throughout {++ADD REST OF IDEA++}   

This links up with what I was trying to get to last week with North's "The Idea of a Writing Center"â€”how to orient library instruction toward a holistic sense of learning, to help students integrate disparate tasks into larger habits of mind and process that engage critically with information.  

## Andrew Battista, "From a 'Crusade against Ignorance' to a 'Crisis of Authenticity': Cultivating Information Literacy for a 21st Century Democracy"
