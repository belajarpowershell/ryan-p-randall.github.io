{>>Why are you a critical librarian? Why do you identify with these ideas? Why do you participate in these chats?<<}  

This is a post for the upcoming #critlib chat: "[#feelings](http://critlib.org/feelings/)".

It's been about 7 years since I read Samuel R. Delany's 1999 [_Times Square Red, Times Square Blue_](http://www.worldcat.org/title/times-square-red-times-square-blue/oclc/40838591) for a course.[^tsrtsb] This unusual gem of a book contains two essays, one a highly personal and somewhat ethnographic account of the interactions between the _habitués_ of the porn theaters on 42nd Street, the other a more traditionally scholastic analysis of the multiple discourses around the theaters that applies insights from [Jane Jacobs' _The Death and Life of Great American Cities_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities).   

[^tsrtsb]: It's not open access, but the [preview of this review](http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/symploke/v008/8.1crowley.html) has all but the last three sentences of the review.   

_Times Square Red, Times Square Blue_ is one of many reasons I'm a critical librarian.  

Delany's words in these two essays transport me to worlds and perspectives otherwise inaccessible to me for many reasons, the most basic of which being that time travel would be necessary for me to witness these places first-hand before my birth. Encountering works like his, intrepid readers can experience situations, places, and scenarios barred to them by time, location, race, gender, class, proclivities, etc., etc., etc.   

Without authors willing to explore multiple—both somewhat complementary & somewhat contradictory—approaches to a subject, I'd be less able to think through complex situations. Without authors bravely disclosing aspects of themselves in their writing, I'd be less able to envision the lifeworlds of other people.  

Without librarians ardently fighting against censorship and actively collecting works from marginalized viewpoints, I'd certainly not have been able to read _Times Square Red, Times Square Blue_ through my university's library.[^nfp]   

[^nfp]: I am _not_ uncritically asserting that everyone should have access to all knowledge, that all knowledge belongs in books, or that merely by reading Delany's words—powerful though his writing is—I can fully and entirely grok his own experiences. Writing and reading are not commensurate to other forms of experience; they're technologies and skills with their own attributes, features, affordances, and limitations.    

In my memory of the two essays, neither addresses the existence of the other; they exist in an unresolved tension, mutually-informing supplements that never settle into a stable arrangement. On this formal level—perhaps on a level that explores the validity of different types of truth claims—the essays acknowledge multiple ways of knowing. Does their twin existence implicitly assert that one must always contend with personal experiences, identities, histories, etc. when writing a purportedly theoretical analysis? Does their plural nature constitute an argument that any lens or perspective can only reveal certain features, leaving blind spots that require others for their illuminating powers?     

Critical librarianship, to me, embraces the diversity in people and the diversity of ways of knowing. I'm deeply suspicious of anyone, or any method, that presumes to have access to an exhaustive, all-encompassing truth. I'm also cognizant that I have my own biases, that I will benefit and learn from other points of view. Different lenses, identities, tendencies, etc. all enable certain things while obfuscating others.    

_Times Square Red, Times Square Blue_ inspires my critical librarianship because it aspires to be an intervention rather than a detached account. In the midst of a controversial redevelopment of Manhattan, Delany asserts that these often-scorned theaters operated as one of the few spaces for meaningful interaction across class and many of the other attributes that commonly divide us. The essays simultaneously aim to intervene in the discourses around the theaters & their inhabitants as well as in the urban redevelopment that will instead reinscribe and fortify the divisions that the theaters helped dissolve.   

Another library, another librarianship, another academy, another world are all possible. Another _me_ is possible. Libraries can—and should—be a crucial infrastructure in this change, and so our attention should be toward improving what we do and how we do so. This can—and should—entail looking at as many different methods of improvement as feasible. This can—and should—mean [respectfully challenging and disagreeing](http://kevinseeber.com/blog/locations-and-residents/) with others and allow our perspectives to become complementary rather than divisive.    

As someone who grew up biting his tongue to stop from blurting out half-formed thoughts in k-12 classes, then moved to only speaking when I felt I was truly contributing something in college, Twitter's been an interesting platform. I can mash out an idea, then think about how to be a little more succinct and not take up too much space.
