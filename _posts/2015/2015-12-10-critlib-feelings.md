Jaded idealism.  

Radical empiricism.  

Revolutionary pragmatism.  

Oddly enough, my experience of the #critlib hashtag 

## Critical engagement with various ways of knowing  

This is what I think of with critical information literacy, with epistemology, with critical theory, with library research: what different ways of knowing enable & what they obfuscate. The scientific method can enable certain types of knowledge, but it alone cannot tell us about ethics. Ethics cannot tell us about which treatments might be most suited for particular patients. Any way of knowing is partial, just like any human's experience—and the more we recognize and embrace this, the better we can be as individual librarians in our various roles.  

## Another Librarianship is Possible   

Another library, another academy, another world are all possible. Libraries can be a crucial infrastructure in this change, and so our attention should be toward improving what we do and how we do so. This can—and should—entail looking at as many different methods of improvement as feasible. Thinking radically as well as thinking pragmatically. Jaded idealism.
