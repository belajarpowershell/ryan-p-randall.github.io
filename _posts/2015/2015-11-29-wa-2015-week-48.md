# Reads this Week  

It's 2015-12-12 and I'm still looking at the rough draft of this post languishing unpublished. So instead of trying to annotate why I like these so much, I'm just going to grab a quote that I hope entices you to read each of them. Clearly, I'm still figuring out what these "Weekly Assemblages" will be! 
{: .notice}

## Barbara Fister's "Costs of Doing More with Less"   

[Costs of Doing More With Less](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/library-babel-fish/cost-doing-more-less)  

> When we’re told to do more with less, we end up building a costly apparatus for generating income while cutting things that actually support the organization’s mission. That distorts everything.  

## Robin Kurz's "We Can Be Heroes"   

[We Can Be Heroes](http://www.transformingamericanlibraries.com/2015/11/we-can-be-heroes.html)   

> We can be and are our own heroes. We are already challenging the LIS status quo in places around the world.  

## Amy Vecchione's "Let's Make Something"   

[Let's Make Something](https://trailheadboise.org/guest-blog-lets-make-something/)   

> The MakerLab is secretly a digital fluency lab because we help anyone. With each workshop, we focus on the outcome: that the workshop attendee has made a video, made a podcast, made a green screen photo. We want to give them great confidence, and steps so that they can do it again!
