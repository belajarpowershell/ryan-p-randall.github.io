This post is for [Week Four](http://rhizomatic.net/2015/05/06/week-4-canshould-we-get-rid-of-the-idea-of-dave-how-do-we-teach-rhizomatically/) of [#rhizo15](http://rhizomatic.net/): "How Do We Teach Rhizomatically?". Even though I'm writing this during Week Five, I'm trying to put my thoughts out a little quicker than usual in this post, in keeping with my post from [Week One]({% post_url /2015/2015-04-20-learning-subjectives %}). 
{: .notice}  

For Week Four, Dave asked:  

> "I think there is value in the ‘course’ in the sense of the eventedness that it represents. It’s a chance for people to come together and focus on a particular topic… it’s one of the ways to garden the internet. But what is the role of the facilitator/teacher/professor where we are using learning subjectives, where learning isn’t measured and where content is actually other people? What cultural concepts do we have that we can use as models? Do we need a new model?

> How do we ‘teach’ rhizomatically? Or, even… do we?"  

This is a great question, particularly since it helps us think about the differences between "teaching" or "facilitating" and a more general "online learning community." In order to help me think it through, I'll examine the online comumunity with which I'm most familiar, [#critlib](http://www.tinyurl.com/critlibx), which is mostly [Twitter-](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23critlib&src=typd) & [Tumlbr-](https://www.tumblr.com/search/%23critlib/recent) based.  

&#035;critlib works with more a facilitation model than a teaching model, for  while there is a small core of moderators who organized regular (weekly or biweekly) Twitter chats using the hashtag, the form is most often an open, hour-long Q & A session around a topic. The hashtag abbreviates "critical librarian*"; the `*` is sort of a Boolean wildcard, so it implies `librarian`, `librarians`, and `librarianship` equally. Critical librarianship predates the community that has connected through the hashtag on social media, thankfully, but the tag's ability to refer ambiguously to the Twitter chats, the social media community that uses the term, the connected pages moderated by the Twitter chats' originators, and/or to critical librarianship has been a nuisance on occasion, particularly during the Twitter chats when character limitations hinder disambiguiation.   

I'm suggesting that a "teaching" model—even its most open, Freirean variation that actively seeks to embrace the authority of the students and blur the student/teacher distinction—revolves around an established person or people who have some authority that persists from instance to instance. A "facilitation" model gets a little more "nomadic," with facilitators only assuming the role of "central authority" on an ad-hoc basis, even if they do so repeatedly for multiple sessions. As Dave's prompt implies, one of the great things about these models is that they help produce an "event," either in the sense of a shift of perception or in the more temporal sense of "Oh! I've gotta make it to Twitter between 9p-10p ET or I'll miss #critlib for the week!" As I'm writing this knowing that the prompt for Week Five concerns community learning, I'm going to leave that for my [next post]() and focus here just on what teaching rhizomatically might mean.
