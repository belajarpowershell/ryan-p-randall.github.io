Held this year in Riverside, CA—my former hometown—the 2015 Cultural Studies Association conference had a number of highlights.  

First of all, I was able to meet & collaborate with [Jessica Critten](), [Karen Nicholson](), and [Eamon Tewell]() on our praxis session, "Critical Information Literacy as Collaborative Praxis." I'd met them all before via the [#critlib chats](http://tinyurl.com/critlibx), but it was great actually getting to host a discussion with them. The "praxis sessions" format involved a mix of a presentation and a set of discussion/workshop portions. Having elsewhere witnessed panels at larger conferences that occasional fail to gel into something cohesive (rather than people successively reading into the void), I appreciated the opportunity to learn along with each other. Getting to meet participants like Elizabeth Sarjeant from Simon Fraser University, [Chris Alen Sula](http://chrisalensula.org/), from Pratt Institute, and [Ivette Bayo Urban](http://bayoart.com) from the University of Washington makes conference sessions that much better.  

Second of all, talking to the [FLOW (Feminist Library on Wheels)](http://feministlibraryonwheels.com/) and [Women's Center for Creative Work](http://womenscenterforcreativework.com/) during a panel in the conference [Makerspace](https://twitter.com/MakeSpaceTho) was quite inspiring. Yes, that's the second Makerspace I've been to in a conference, with the other being the equally fantastic [Collective]() conference! The WCCW creators have a great image of creating "enabling architecture" that seems a really compelling figure for talking about libraries and other infrastructures for thought, reflection, and action.  


Third, the ongoing discussions about the conference theme—"Another University is Possible" consistently helped me reconsider our higher education practices.   

And I got to hear, among many others, Angela McRobbie, Fred Moten, and Jonathan Sterne! I also got to meet some  of the [FemTechNet]() leaders.
