This week I finished a book I've slowly been reading online via Indiana University's library system: Luciano Floridi's [*Information: A Very Short Introduction*](http://www.worldcat.org/title/information-a-very-short-introduction/oclc/827743552). Here I'll briefly write up my thoughts on it, then briefly discuss the recent threat to the Tor exit node being run by the Lebanon, New Hampshire Public Library.  

## Luciano Floridi's *Information: A Very Short Introduction*   

Ultimately, I'm quite glad that I took the time to read this and would recommend it to anyone who has already considered reading it or anyone looking for an insightful yet short introduction to the topic. However, considering my own critical leanings toward cultural studies, I remain more moved by the more critical accounts of information given by people like Ron Day and Lawrence Grossberg. Therefore, I'd would recommend Day's *The Modern Invention of Information* or any of a number of places where Grossberg has addressed information and communication, perhaps his 1979 "Interpreting the 'Cricis' of Culture in Communications Theory."  

I recently finished a book I'd been reading via Indiana University's online collections: Maria Accardi's [*Feminist Pedagogy for Library Instruction*](http://www.worldcat.org/title/feminist-pedagogy-for-library-instruction/oclc/847529221).  

I'll also write up 

## Philips and Lowery's "The Hard-Knock life? Whites Claim Hardships in Response to Racial Inequity"   

Summary of the article by Kerry A. Dolan at [Insights by Stanford Business](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/why-whites-downplay-their-individual-racial-privileges) does a good job of distilling the longer article, although the original provides enough additional context that it is well worth your additonal reading time. You can find it [here at Stanford](http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/gsb/files/publications/phillipslowery_hardknocklife_2015jesp_0.pdf) or perhaps [here at ScienceDirect](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103115000852).
