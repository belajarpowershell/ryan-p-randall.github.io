I recently finished a book I'd been reading via Indiana University's online collections: Maria Accardi's [*Feminist Pedagogy for Library Instruction*](http://www.worldcat.org/title/feminist-pedagogy-for-library-instruction/oclc/847529221).  

I'll also write up 

## Philips and Lowery's "The Hard-Knock life? Whites Claim Hardships in Response to Racial Inequity"   

Summary of the article by Kerry A. Dolan at [Insights by Stanford Business](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/why-whites-downplay-their-individual-racial-privileges) does a good job of distlling the longer article, although the original provides enough additional context that it is well worth your additonal reading time. You can find it [here at Stanford](http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/gsb/files/publications/phillipslowery_hardknocklife_2015jesp_0.pdf) or perhaps [here at ScienceDirect](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103115000852).
