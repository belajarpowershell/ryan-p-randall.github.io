## #critlib chat on Information Resources &amp; Incarcerated People   

On Monday, 2016-01-04, I was lucky to co-moderate a #critlib chat with Seattle's [Books to Prisoners](http://www.bookstoprisoners.net/) on [information resources &amp; incarcerated people](http://critlib.org/information-resources-and-incarcerated-people/).   

Here's a [Storify archive](https://storify.com/catladylib/critlib-information-resources-and-incarcerated-peo) of the chat, put together by [Annie Pho](https://catladylibrarian.wordpress.com/).   

## Reading Since Last Update (Over Holidays &amp; This Week)  

- Maybe write about first half of Giroux's _On Critical Pedagogy_? Either try to isolate some themes or else talk about why I like &amp; would recommend one or two chapters in particular.  

"Schooling and the Culture of Positivism" is a good option.   

- Mention [#moocmooc on Instructional Design](http://www.digitalpedagogylab.com/mooc-mooc-instructional-design/)  

- Mention [Nuzzel app](http://nuzzel.com/about), which aggregates the news or links shared by the people you follow on Twitter.
