## Reading Since Last Update (Holidays &amp; This Week)  



Maybe write about first half of Giroux's _On Critical Pedagogy_? Either try to isolate some themes or else talk about why I like &amp; would recommend one or two chapters in particular.  

"Schooling and the Culture of Positivism" is a good option.
