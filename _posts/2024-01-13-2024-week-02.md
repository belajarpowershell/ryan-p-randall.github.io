## Shaving the Wrong Yak  

Or, occasionally, ["procrastivity"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/rethinking-adult-adhd/202007/procrastivity-aka-sneaky-avoidance-and-adult-adhd-coping).  

Samuel Robert Mathias' [Scholarly references in Jekyll](https://crackedbassoon.com/writing/references) details some clever, although tedious to set up, ways to generate citations using Liquid in a static site. This means that for a Jekyll-based site, like mine, you wouldn't need to use one of the various plugins, like [Jekyll-Scholar](), which also do this… but at the cost of not being entirely compatible with GitHub Pages.
