As I've mentioned a few times, I began using Obsidian earlier this year. Ultimately, the Tasks plugin was what convinced me to adopt it, despite my fondness for Dendron and my general hesitations/frustrations about Obsidian.  

It took quite a bit of delving into the Obsidian Discord forums and subsequent experimentation to figure out some of the queries and filters that best suit my brain.  

If you're considering using a Markdown-related tool for tracking tasks, you might take a look at my note on the [Obsidian Tasks plugin patterns]({% link _notes/Note-taking/Obsidian/obsidian-tasks-plugin-patterns.md %}) I've found most useful.
