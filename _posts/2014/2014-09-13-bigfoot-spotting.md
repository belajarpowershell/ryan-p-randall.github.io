Here's a test of Bigfoot.js, a rather awesome addition to the web. [^bgft] (Not working at the moment.)  

[^bgft]: You can find this arcane, hirsute magick [here](http://www.bigfootjs.com/) courtesy of Chris SauveÃÅ, a Canadian otherwise [known as lemonmade](https://github.com/lemonmade).  

Sooner or later I'll write a post detailing how I've made this site so far. I would still like to add two main things to it: the Bigfoot.js footnote functionality and an alternate stylesheet in the vein of Brett Terpstra's [SuperReadable](http://brettterpstra.com/). His hides under a gear in the top right corner of his site, and allows visitors to switch to a stylesheet that uses [OpenDyslexic](http://opendyslexic.org/), a free and open source font designed for dyslexic readers.   

The process of making this site with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) has been a rewarding foray into using the command line interface, but it initially took quite a bit longer than I'd hoped. So I anticipate creating a brief series of steps from my old process notes as I was putting this together. Jekyll's a great blogging alternative to WordPress that uses fewer resources (i.e. doesn't require a database) and can be hosted for free on GitHub pages, making it great for LibSchool students who want to create a site that will be a bit more of a learning opportunity.
