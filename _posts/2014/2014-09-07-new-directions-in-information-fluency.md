On April 4th & 5th, I drove up to Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois with my friend & colleague [Katherine Ahnberg](http://katherineahnberg.wordpress.com/) for the [New Directions in Information Literacy conference](http://www.augustana.edu/x59440.xml) at Augustana College.  

As [Katherine recently wrote](http://katherineahnberg.wordpress.com/2014/08/24/bringing-digital-humanities-to-the-desk/), we presented a brief history of humanities computing (digital humanities or DH), an overview of how DH often interfaces with libraries, and demonstrated a number of easily-adopted tools that reference librarians might recommend to students/researchers curious about what computing approaches can do for humanities inquiry. This primer, along with our slides, are hosted at [dhreadyreference](https://github.com/ryan-p-randall/dhreadyreference) on GitHub.[^yghb] We may go back and annotate or expand the entries, but for anyone curious about digital humanities and libraries, or tools with low learning curves, I hope this provides a useful introduction.   

Should you find it useful—or should you like to add things or ask for clarification—feel free to [get in touch](https://twitter.com/foureyedsoul).   

[^yghb]: We specifically chose to put it on GitHub because, as graduate students, we knew we'd have access to it beyond our years at IU-Bloomington. On top of that, we wanted to demonstrate the relative ease with which it can be used as a repository for these sorts of things.
