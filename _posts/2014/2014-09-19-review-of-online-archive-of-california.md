The [Online Archive of California](http://www.oac.cdlib.org/) serves as a centralized set of links to and descriptions of an enormous number of online collections from various archives, historical societies, libraries, museums, and special collections in California, including each campus of the University of California. According to the OAC's about page, this makes for over 200 contributing institutions, more than 20,000 online collection guides, and more than 220,000 digital images and documents.[^about] Administered by the Digital Special Collections program of University of California's California Digital Library (CDL), the Collection aims to increase the ease with which collections held throughout a variety of Californian institutions can be found by researchers. In addition to increasing this "findability," the Archive benefits the involved member institutions by giving access to a variety of tools, services, and training from the OAC, as well as by expanding grant opportunities as a result of the partnership with the CDL. As a project, the OAC goes back to a prototype finding aid standard made in 1993 at the UC Berkeley Libraries. In 1995, several University of California libraries began "UC-EAD" to test Encoded Archival Description to integrate access to collections information across the UC campuses. The project outgrew its initial UC cross-campus scope and was renamed the Online Archive of California in 1998 when it began including information about collections housed elsewhere.[^elsewhere] Due to its consortial nature, it's difficult to determine when the resources available through the OAC were last available. The site also does not provide an easily-found list of when collections were added to its list, but for what it is worth, the CDL's page about the OAC was last updated on 13 December, 2013.[^CDLOAC] The CDL Digital Special Collections administers the OAC, but its component descriptions and representative digital files come from the member institutions.

This Digital Special Collections team includes six people: a "Director," "Technical Lead," "Program Coordinator," "Contributor Support Specialist," "Programmer Analyst," and "Data Consultant." It appears that five work in Oakland and one in San Diego. Although the team does not list every member's background, their previous experience appears to vary in precisely the way that seems common to digital humanities/digital libraries work: Catherine Mitchell, the Director, has a Ph.D. in English Literature from UC Berkeley and was previously the Web Director at the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco; Brian Tingle, the Technical Lead, received a B.S> in Ecology, Behavior, & Evolution from UC San Diego and has worked from the UC Libraries since 1996; and Adrian Turner, the Data Consultant, earned an MLIS from UCLA and an MA from UC Santa Cruz and has worked as an archivist and manuscripts processor at UC Irvine Special Collections and Archives, among other places. The OAC has a broad focus, taking any collection held by a Californian archive, college, historical society, library, museum, special collection, or university as its subject. As shown in the image below, content in the OAC is browsable by institution, by collection, and by location on a map—the last of which must be particularly useful to visiting researchers unfamiliar with the size and geography of California.
