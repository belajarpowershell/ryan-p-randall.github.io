Thanks for coming by, and for indulging my Depeche Mode reference.[^nl] This new site is decidedly in an early state of becoming, as I figure out how to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and this particular [theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).  

I'll probably use this for more long-form writing and keep the shorter things over at my Tumblr site, [Foureyedsoul](http://foureyedsoul.tumblr.com). The Tumblarians over there are a good bunch—sociable, generous, witty, and insightful. Why not [check them out for yourself?](http://thelifeguardlibrarian.tumblr.com/tumblarians)

[^nl]: Clicking the title of this post should take you to YouTube, to help you know the song if you're not already humming along.
