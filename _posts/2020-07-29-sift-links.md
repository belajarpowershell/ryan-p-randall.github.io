Here are some links related to my submission to the ["innovative ideas" lightning talk / virtual poster session](https://flipgrid.com/93f8f2f7) of the [2020 MOSS Meetup](https://libraries.idaho.gov/moss2020/) organized by ICfL.  

## The SIFT Moves  

- [Introducing SIFT, a Four Moves Acronym](https://hapgood.us/2019/05/12/sift-and-a-check-please-preview/), Mike Caulfield's initial post about the moves  
- [Check, Please! Course](https://www.notion.so/Check-Please-Starter-Course-ae34d043575e42828dc2964437ea4eed), an OER textbook with explanations and demonstrations of the moves  
- Caulfield's [SIFTing through the Pandemic](https://infodemic.blog) applies the moves to claims about COVID-19
