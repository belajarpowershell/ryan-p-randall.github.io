[Weekly Whaaaâ€¦?]({% post_url 2016-01-09-weekly-whaaa %}) I'm doing a few of these quite after the fact. 
{: .notice}  

One of the highlights of this week was the #critlib chat on [Patience and Impatience](http://critlib.org/patience-impatience/), moderated by Lisa Hinchliffe , Cecily Walker, and April Hathcock. It was "a chance for everyone to talk about the struggles we face in wanting to do important social justice work and to see change immediately when reality is often much different." Violet Fox was kind enough to make a [Storify archive](https://storify.com/violetbfox/critlib-patience-impatience) of it!     

Another highlight was reading Alison Hick's [LibGuides: Pedagogy to Oppress?](http://www.digitalpedagogylab.com/hybridped/libguides-pedagogy-to-oppress/) article at HybridPedagogy after seeing it highly recommended on Twitter. I particularly appreciate how she both links the customary uses of LibGuides to Freirean ideas of liberation pedagogy AND gives a number of examples of alternate routes to take either within the LibGuides platform or augmenting it with other tools.
