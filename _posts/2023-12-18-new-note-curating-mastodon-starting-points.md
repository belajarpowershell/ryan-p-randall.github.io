Thankfully, many people have written useful guides to getting started with the community-run social media network called Mastodon. Instead of writing up my own, I'm curating a short list of the most useful ones I find over at my [[Mastodon starting points]] note.  

Most of these guides will be aimed at people in higher education trying to find similar folks, rather than users more broadly.
