I recently wrote a post for [Hack Library School](http://hacklibraryschool.com/2015/08/13/this-is-not-a-pipette/) on examples of how we might break humanities methodologies to bear on information studies. In part, I wrote this in response to the recent statement by the editors of *College & Research Libraries*  that they are looking for papers that use critical theory, among other methodologies beyond LIS strictly conceived as a social science. Paul T. Jager also usefully compares LIS to education in that practitioners in both fields tend to have a Master's degree and emphasize practice over research.  

There's also brief summaries of a few articles that use humanities methodologies and critical theory quite well. If you have other examples that you're fond of, I'd love to hear about them!
