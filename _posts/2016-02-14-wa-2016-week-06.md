[Weekly Whaaa…?]({% post_url 2016-01-09-weekly-whaaa %}) Here's another post I'm doing well after the fact.  
{: .notice}  

The highlight of this week was attending [#THATCampBSU](http://boisestate2016.thatcamp.org/), an unconference around The Humanities and Technology. I met an [awful lot of cool people](http://boisestate2016.thatcamp.org/campers/) ranging from local activists to coders to librarians. Thankfully, almost everyone there seemed to wear multiple of those hats, too!   

Organized by a three-person team including [Memo Cordova](http://guides.boisestate.edu/prf.php?account_id=4254), I'm definitely hoping they get the funds to do it again next year.  

In case you haven't heard of THATCamp before, they're put on routinely in many places. Here's the [calendar of upcoming ones](http://thatcamp.org)—maybe there's one near you?
