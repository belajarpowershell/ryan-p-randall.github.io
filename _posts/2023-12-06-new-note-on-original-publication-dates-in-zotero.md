For those of us who work in the humanities and social sciences, it's common for sources to have been published in multiple versions. But Zotero only has a single date field! **Great Scott!** How do we deal with the complexities of time?  

For instance, how would one indicate that Samuel Delany's _Nova_ was initially published in 1968, even though the edition we're referencing was published in 2002?  

Here's where Zotero's `Extra` field comes in handy! I've just added a new [[Zotero Advanced Features]] note where I explain how to do this. I'll continue adding to that note as I learn to do additional less-than-obvious things with Zotero.
