## SWILA UnConference 2016   

The Southwest Idaho Library UnConference, held at the Collister branch of the Boise Public Library, went wonderfully! Here's what [people tweeted about it](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SWILA16?src=hash). For me, the (unplanned!) outreach session was a highlight, as well as the very planned user experience one.   

## Read Hansson on Mouffe in LIS   

After being recommended it by someone on Twitter (_probably_ Lauren Smith, but it's been a while so I'm not sure), I read Joacim Hansson's chapter "Chantal Mouffe's theory of agonistic pluralism and its relevance for library and information science research" from [_Critical theory for library and information science: exploring the social from across the disciplines_](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/548555609). It's a very good introduction of her thought and definitely worth reading if you've any interest in how libraries play a role in democracies. I very well may write up reading notes on it before long.
