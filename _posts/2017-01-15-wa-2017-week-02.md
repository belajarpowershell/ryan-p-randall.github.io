#### VukanJ's "bibtex-helper" for Atom  

Ever since I first read Dennis Tenen and Grant Wythoff's [Sustainable Authorship in Plain Text using Pandoc and Markdown](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown) lesson at [The Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org), I've been into the idea of using [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/index.html) and [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org). I haven't done so extensively—just for the last semester of library school, so far.  

However, I really like the idea of using simplified citekeys, so I'm putting together a system around this now. Which is where VukanJ's [bibtext-helper](https://github.com/VukanJ/bibtex-helper) comes in. I'm trying to use the Atom editor whenever I can, and VukanJ's tool is basically a set of snippets I can invoke by putting the citation style (e.g. `@inproceedings` or `@article`) and Atom will expand that into a citation template with all the appropriate fields for that type of citation. At first I couldn't figure out how to add it to Atom, since VukanJ's documentation is…let's say "light." I eventually just hit select-all on [this file](https://github.com/VukanJ/bibtex-helper/blob/master/snippets/bibtex-snippets.cson), copied everything, then pasted it into my `snippets.cson` file in Atom. At first it didn't work, so I changed the `'.text.bibtex'` in line 1 to `'.text.md'`. Now it sings! I did alter a few things—specifically adding `@crossref = {}` to the `@inbook`, `@incollection`, `@inproceedings`, and `@inreference` snippets, as Nelson H. F. Beebe's super-helpful [guide](http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/bibnet/bibtex-info.html#crossref) suggests. I also added `address = {}` to the relevant snippets.  

For the last few things I wrote, I used Zotero and then Bibdesk, but I profoundly didn't like how that combination wouldn't let me change the citekey. Time isn't inherently meaningful in my mind, so I'd much rather cite something as `@hall_local_and_global` than `@hall_1989a`. I also didn't like how the Zotero + Bibdesk citations would seem to arbitrarily decide to force capitalization. Although I wanted to take a cataloging course in library school, I never did. Even though I'd assisted with a bit of copy cataloging (finding and selecting what I considered to be the best record of maps for IU, to help speed up things for the actual cataloger), now I feel like I can empathize with catalogers even more.  

I'm thinking I might put up my main bibliography file on Github somewhere, either as part of this site or somewhere else. It'd be nice to be able to refer to those citekeys from anywhere I might be writing or making reading notes.
