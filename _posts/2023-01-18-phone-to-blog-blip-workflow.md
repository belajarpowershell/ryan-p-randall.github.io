## Couch to Internet  

With a cat snoozing on my lap and less than 10 minutes before I'm supposed to start watching a new-to-me episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, the thought occurred to me: __how quickly could I make a blog post happen?__  

Long ago I set up Working Copy on my iPhone. It's an app that helps you handle a Git repository. If I recall correctly, I set it up as an extra "safety net" for giving presentations using Reveal; I wanted to make sure I had a way to fix typos or other last-minute edits.  

Now I'm instead trying to see whether this app could be repurposed as an POSSE-mindset alternative to Mastodon or other microblogging platforms.  

It's been 10 minutes! Let's commit this!
