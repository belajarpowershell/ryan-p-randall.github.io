Here's another decidedly-after-the-fact postâ€”who knew that moving could upend so many things?  

This week I began my position as the Instruction and Outreach Librarian at [the College of Western Idaho](http://www.cwidaho.cc)! Peculiarly enough, my starting date aligned with the annual conference of the Idaho state library association. Rather than have me attempt to man the library as a brand-new librarian with no experience regarding CWI's procedures, policies, or systems, they were kind enough to let me attend the conference. That way I was able to rapidly get perspective on how the Boise metropolitan area's community college fits into the state's overall public library and educational systems.   

The conference and panels I attended merit their own post, but for now I'll just say that Idaho has **tons** of personable, knowledgable, and passionate librarians working at all kinds of libraries. Here's a link to Kate Radford's [Storify of #ILABoise2015 tweets](https://storify.com/fabrikate/ila-2015).
