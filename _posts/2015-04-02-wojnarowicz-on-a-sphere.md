:warning: :construction:

This post is currently under construction. The actual project grew out of an assignment for [John Walsh's](http://biblicon.org/about) "Z652 Digital Libraries" [course](http://www.soic.indiana.edu/graduate/courses/index.html?number=z652&department=ILS) at IU-Bloomington.

When I learned that we would be doing a mapping project for John Walsh's Digital Humanities course, two artists quickly sprang to mind due to their extensive use of spatial imagery in their works. Although I began the project intending to map Laurie Anderson's career of gallery shows, I was able to find a complete set of source data for David Wojnarowicz's exhibitions through his gallery's site. As I discovered throughout that class, much of the digital humanities mindset revolves around learning which meaningful parts of humanities inquiry can be captured through data points.

I've gone ahead and put this up on YouTube, at least for now, as the best way to stream the video showing how this project worked.
