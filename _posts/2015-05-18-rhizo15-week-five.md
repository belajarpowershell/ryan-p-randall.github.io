This post is for [Week Five](http://rhizomatic.net/2015/05/12/week-5-is-community-learning-an-invasive-species/) of [#rhizo15](http://rhizomatic.net/): "Is Community Learning an Invasive Species?". I'm trying to put my thoughts out a little quicker than usual in this post, in keeping with my post from [Week One]({% post_url 2015-04-20-learning-subjectives %}).
