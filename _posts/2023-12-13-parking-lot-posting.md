When I first got a smartphone so many years ago, I was excited mostly about having a device that could help with some of my ADHD issues; basically the same "keeping track of ideas and intentions" things I'd used a day planner or bullet journal for previously. I'd seen people with PDAs and thought "wow, those could be useful!"  

Now it's odd to have a global communicator in my pocket and constantly be drawn to the immediacy of that kind of communication. I was just checking in on folks I know on Mastodon and on Discord, who live not only in different states or countries but entirely different continents.  

I'd like to attempt writing more frequently in these little liminal/interstitial moments, rather than going directly to social media. That's part of why I'm using Obsidian now, for instance, and why I've made a Digital Garden that I can always prune or refine. I'm also interested in seeing what beneficial friction I encounter when writing for Jekyll here from my phone. It's harder to make wikilinks, so I might want to make some keyboard shortcuts for the patterns I often use but don't have committed character-by-character to memory.
