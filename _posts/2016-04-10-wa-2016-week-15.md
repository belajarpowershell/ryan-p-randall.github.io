## Radical Librarians #radlibchat  

This week, the Radical Librarians hosted a [chat with April Hathcock](https://rlc.radicallibrarianship.org/2016/04/07/radlibchat-12th-april-2016/).  

## UC Davis wants some scrubs   

UC Davis paid consultants at least $175,000 for [attempts to scrub the Internet](http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article71659992.html) of links about their pepper spraying of nonviolent student protestors.  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">someones going to write about how UC Davis quest to scrub the internet of pepper-spray is great ex of why we need web archiving, yes?</p>&mdash; Chris Bourg (@mchris4duke) <a href="https://twitter.com/mchris4duke/status/720660507053723650">April 14, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

As Chris Bourg points out, this is an excellent example of why web archiving can be useful.  

## Infrastructures of Student Engagement & Dissent  

Having proudly graduated from University of California, Riverside for both undergrad and an MA in English, I believe it's paramount to keep the student protesting history readily accessible. This type of involvement in democracy is both healthy and necessary. Similarly, we need to keep the history of administrators' attempts to quell this type of involvement readily accessible.  

As just one of many examples, UC San Diego's [Che Cafe](http://thechecafe.blogspot.com/p/about.html) is a continually imperiled student-run space that provides both institutional memory and an infrastructure of student-led agitation for better governance of the UC system. 

Students also produce disorientation guides that reframe, question, and contest official rhetoric about institutions and the goals of education. Here's links to a few disorientation manuals:   

You can read the plain text of a [2010 UC Berkeley Disorientation Guide]( https://archive.org/stream/216605-uc-disorientation-guide/216605-uc-disorientation-guide_djvu.txt) at archive.org.  
Here's a [2011-2012 UC Santa Cruz Disorientation Guide](http://www.campusactivism.org/server-new/uploads/2011_ucsc_disorientation_guide.pdf) as a pdf file.  
Here's another [UC Santa Crus Disorientation Guide, from 2009-2010](https://www.indybay.org/uploads/2009/09/26/ucsc-disguide-2009.pdf).  
Campus Activism has a great [roundup from different years & campuses](http://www.campusactivism.org/displaycategory-4.htm).  

## Revolting Librarians  

In keeping with this theme of dissent, it's worth linking to [_Revolting Librarians_](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/479117) and [_Revolting librarians redux : radical librarians speak out_](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52055828) as instances of dissent within librarianship. I'd love it if someone were to do a sort of "history of critical librarianship," and I certainly expect these books would play a role.
