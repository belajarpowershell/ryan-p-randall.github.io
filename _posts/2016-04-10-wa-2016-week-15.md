## Radical Librarians #radlibchat  

This week, the Radical Librarians hosted a [chat with April Hathcock](https://rlc.radicallibrarianship.org/2016/04/07/radlibchat-12th-april-2016/).  

## UC Davis wants some scrubs   

- [ ] Add links to [Boing Boing?]() etc about how UC Davis attempted to scrub the Internet of links about their pepper spraying of nonviolent student protestors.  

- [ ] Add context of web archiving and embed [Chris Bourg's tweet](https://twitter.com/mchris4duke/status/720660507053723650)also of [Student Disorientation Manuals]()  

- [ ] Add extra bit about how, having gone to a University of California, I believe it's paramount to keep the student protesting history, and the history of administrators' attempts to quell it, readily accessible. The [Che Cafe]() is one continually imperiled student-run space that provides both institutional memory and an infrastructure of student-led agitation for better governance of the UC system.

## Acumen: Human-Centered Design
