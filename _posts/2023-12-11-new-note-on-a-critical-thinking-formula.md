I just wrote a new note on a set of questions I realize I've come to use as a handy starter [[critical thinking formula]].  

The list started out as me reminding myself to ask "for whom, under what conditions"â€”effectively, [Frederic Jameson's "always historicize!" suggestion](https://web.archive.org/web/20230807003329/https://www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/english/theory/postmodernism/modules/jamesonpomomainframe.html) in a nut shell.  

Then I just kept adding a few more mental questions, and now we've got this list.
