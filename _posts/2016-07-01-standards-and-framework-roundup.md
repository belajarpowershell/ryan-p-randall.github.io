A lot of intelligent librarians are continuing to write intelligent things about the now rescinded [ACRL Standards]() and the [ACRL Framework]() that has replaced them. I don't feel the need to add to the chatter around it, but it seems useful to round up some of the most prominent or insightful posts I've read. I'll probably update this list I see fit, but I promise not to make it into an all-encompassing [Katamari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari_Damacy) ball.  

![Katamari on the Horizon](http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/145711-katamari-damacy)  

- Emily Drabinski's [""]()  

- Barbara Fister's ["On the Latest Docudrama"](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/library-babel-fish/latest-docudrama).  

Here Fister usefully reminds us of the difference between the work that documents perform and the work that librarians and educators perform with students.  

- Lane Wilkinson's [""]()

- Tessa Withorn's ["Scholarship is a Conversation with Many Voices"](https://acriticalsummer.wordpress.com/2016/07/01/scholarship-is-a-conversation-with-many-voices/)  

Withorn's post has round-up aspects similar to the one you're currently reading, only with much more involved commentary.   


{++Oh, actual thoughts:  

- Perhaps the problem with the _Framework_ is that despite trying to discuss "information" more as a process, the document remains caught up in the dominant LIS rhetoric of information as a thing. Perhaps what we fundamentally need is a different approach to "information," to regard it as a condition humans ascribe to documents or data, rather than reifying information into a "thing" unto itself.   

- I should look again at the _Framework_ and the _Standards_ with this in mind, to write something about it.  

- Question of assessment & "standard"-ized approaches & a reminder that we work, but under conditions not of our own making. We endeavor to discuss information in a way that accurately conveys our understanding of its nuances, but at the same time, many librarians work at institutions that view assessment as the only way to validate instruction. (Yes, that's what Giroux would describe as the culture of positivism, as an objectivism run rampant rather than merely using objectivity to refine our teaching methods.)   

- Still need to find ways of discussing what I mean by information as a condition or a relation rather than as a thing. A sort of radical empiricism with regards to reading documents; seeing the content - form - communication - interpretation chain as not transparent / neutral / hypodermic but rather as profoundly mediated.
