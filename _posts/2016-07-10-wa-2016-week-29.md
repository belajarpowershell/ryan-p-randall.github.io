   - transfer over ideas about this to my "Weekly Assemblage" post for the week, linking it back to the presentation [Amy]() and [Deena]() gave at the [Idaho Library Association]() unconference this year, as well as to the IDEO thing I did with some other librarians at CWI and BSU.


## Site Maintenance This Week  

Briefly discuss why I changed fonts?  

I added [Academicons]()!   

Updated the colophon a little bit.
