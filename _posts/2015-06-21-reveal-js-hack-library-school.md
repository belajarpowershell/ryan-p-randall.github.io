Here's a [post I wrote](http://hacklibraryschool.com/2015/06/18/presentation-alternatives-reveal/) for Hack Library School talking about my experience with the [Reveal.js JavaScript presentation framework](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/). Not only does it hew to my goal of choosing open-source tools over proprietary formats whenever feasible, its functionality and inherent ability to make presentations shareable on the web make it vastly preferable to tools like PowerPoint or Keynote.   

As librarians, academics, archivists, and/or instructors, we should consider the effects of the formats we choose. How durable are they? How accessible are they? Whose interests do they serve? Whether you frame this as ["<strike>format </strike> information creation as a process"](http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/ilframework#process), something closer to ["format as culture,"](http://computationalculture.net/article/reflections-on-the-mp3-format) or even ["we jam econo,"](https://books.google.com/books?id=o7CZRPZ27TQC&lpg=PT13&pg=PT14#v=onepage&q=econo&f=false) please be deliberate.   

The post at Hack Library School sits within a series introducing and explaining alternatives to PowerPoint, so it's not quite a how-to sort of post. If you'd like pointers, please do feel free to get in touch via Twitter or when I add them—which I expect will be soon—the [Jekyll Static Comments](https://github.com/ldesgrange/jekyll-static-comments) system that I'm slowly working out.

I found a great tutorial today: [Reveal.js for Beginners](http://htmlcheats.com/reveal-js/reveal-js-tutorial-reveal-js-for-beginners/). If you're looking at implementing this on your own site, I'd highly recommend starting there.  

Also, I'd like to elaborate a little on the multiple, intersecting types of accessibility I think this type of mobile, audience-member-controllable slide presentations promotes:  

- mobile device  
   - economic  
- people with disabilities  
   - low-vision / blind (i.e. relies on screen reader technology)   
   - people with attention disabilities (ADHD, dyslexia, executive dysfunction resulting from a wide variety of causes, etc.)  
- pedagogical accessibility  

Many of these overlap, of course. For instance, it's quite common for economically underprivileged people to own or have access to a mobile device but not a laptop. We see this continually at the community college where I work! We also work with—and indeed, are ourselves—students, instructors, librarians, and staff with what I'm calling attention disabilities.   

These attention disabilities bring us to pedagogical accessibility. How many times have you wanted to write down a link or reference that was the last thing on a slide, but the speaker advances it just a few moments too quickly? How many times do you wish you could go back to see a term or definition introduced earlier in the talk, but couldn't?  

Giving your audience the ability to engage with your slides as you talk effectively aides your audience in becoming actual interlocutors, able to engage with your ideas on their terms & at their speeds rather than keeping them passively stuck to your timing. This promotes the attitude of generosity and loving kindness that I associate with bell hooks' writings.[^bh1]   

[^bh1]: It's late as I write this and I've got a few of her works muddled together. I've recently read most of [_Teaching to Transgress_](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30668295), a [conversation between her and Thich Nhat Hanh](http://www.lionsroar.com/bell-hooks-and-thich-nhat-hanh-on-building-a-community-of-love/), and an [interview with her at _Tricycle_](http://tricycle.org/magazine/agent-change-an-interview-with-bell-hooks/), so I'm not sure what to cite for this notion at the moment. If I haven't revised this by firming up a reference, please [reach out to me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/foureyedsoul) and I'll try to figure it out or point you in a good direction.  

All that said, one still needs to add `alt` descriptions to images in Reveal.js talks. Since I initially made the slides I routinely use at my library for my initial interview, which happened as I was still learning how to make slides with this javascript framework, I neglected to do this. I have just gone back and fixed that right now.   

Or as I said in today's [#critlib chat](https://storify.com/AlicePrael/intro-to-critlib-part-2), #critlib is a process. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Many comm coll students have mobile devices w/o laptops @ home. Need to make slides more screenreader accessible now. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/critlib?src=hash">#critlib</a> is a process!</p>&mdash; Ryan P. Randall (@foureyedsoul) <a href="https://twitter.com/foureyedsoul/status/717055097742622722">April 4, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>  

If there's one "should" statement I feel comfortable making, it's that we should continually try to do better, collectively and individually. Part of doing better involves, to the degree individually possible, being willing to point out our own mistakes and how we're improving what we've done.  

Or in the immortal words of Bill S. Preston, Esq., "Be Excellent to Each Other."
