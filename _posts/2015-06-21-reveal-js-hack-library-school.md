Here's a [post I wrote](http://hacklibraryschool.com/2015/06/18/presentation-alternatives-reveal/) for Hack Library School talking about my experience with the [Reveal.js JavaScript presentation framework](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/). Not only does it hew to my goal of choosing open-source tools over proprietary formats whenever feasible, its functionality and inherent ability to make presentations shareable on the web make it vastly preferable to tools like PowerPoint or Keynote.   

As librarians, academics, archivists, and/or instructors, we should consider the effects of the formats we choose. How durable are they? How accessible are they? Whose interests do they serve? Whether you frame this as ["<strike>format </strike> information creation as a process"](http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/ilframework#process), something closer to ["format as culture"](http://computationalculture.net/article/reflections-on-the-mp3-format), or even ["we jam econo"](https://books.google.com/books?id=o7CZRPZ27TQC&lpg=PT13&pg=PT14#v=onepage&q=econo&f=false), please be deliberate.   

The post at Hack Library School sits within a series introducing and explaining alternatives to PowerPoint, so it's not quite a how-to sort of post. If you'd like pointers, please do feel free to get in touch via Twitter or when I add them—which I expect will be soon—the [Jekyll Static Comments](https://github.com/ldesgrange/jekyll-static-comments) system that I'm slowly working out.

I found a great tutorial today, [Reveal.js for Beginners](http://htmlcheats.com/reveal-js/reveal-js-tutorial-reveal-js-for-beginners/). If you're looking at implementing this on your own site, I'd recommend starting there.  

Also, I'd like to elaborate a little on the multiple, intersecting types of accessibility I think Reveal.js promotes:  

- mobile device  
   - economic  
- people with disabilities  
   - low-vision / blind (i.e. relies on screen reader technology)   
   - people with attention disabilities (ADHD, dyslexia, executive dysfunction resulting from a wide variety of causes, etc.)  
- pedagogical accessibility  

Many of these overlap, of course. For instance, it's quite common for economically underprivileged people to own or have access to a mobile device but not a laptop. We see this continually at the community college where I work! We also work with a ton of students, instructors, librarians, and staff with what I'm calling attention disabilities.   

These attention disabilities bring us to pedagogical accessibility. How many times have you wanted to write down a link that was the last thing brought up on a slide, but the speaker advances it too quickly? How many times do you wish you could go back to see a definition introduced earlier in the talk, but couldn't? 

By giving your audience the ability to engage with your slides as you talk, Reveal.js asks your audience to become actual interlocutors, able to engage with your ideas on their terms & at their speeds rather than keeping them passively stuck to your timing.   

All that said, one still needs to add alt-text descriptions to Reveal.js talks. Since I initially made the slides I routinely use at my library for my initial interview, right I was still learning how Reveal.js worked, I neglected to do this. I should go back and do that now.   

Or as I said in today's [#critlib chat](http://www.critlib.org), #critlib is a process.
