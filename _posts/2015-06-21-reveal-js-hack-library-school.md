Here's a [post I wrote](http://hacklibraryschool.com/2015/06/18/presentation-alternatives-reveal/) for Hack Library School talking about my experience with the [Reveal.js JavaScript presentation framework](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/). Not only does it hew to my goal of choosing open-source tools over proprietary formats whenever feasible, its functionality and inherent ability to make presentations sharable on the web make it vastly preferable to tools like PowerPoint or Keynote.   

As librarians, academics, archivists, and/or instructors, we should consider the effects of the formats we choose. How durable are they? How accessible are they? Whose interests do they serve? Whether you frame this ["<strike>format </strike> information creation as a process"](http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/ilframework#process), something closer to ["format as culture"](http://computationalculture.net/article/reflections-on-the-mp3-format), or even ["we jam econo"](https://books.google.com/books?id=o7CZRPZ27TQC&lpg=PT13&pg=PT14#v=onepage&q=econo&f=false), please be deliberate.   

The post at Hack Library School sits within a series introducing and explaining alternatives to PowerPoint, so it's not quite a how-to sort of post. If you'd like pointers, please do feel free to get in touch via Twitter or when I add them—which I expect will be soon—the [Jekyll Static Comments](https://github.com/ldesgrange/jekyll-static-comments) system that I'm slowly working out.
