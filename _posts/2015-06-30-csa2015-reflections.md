Held this year in Riverside, CA—my former hometown—the 2015 Cultural Studies Association conference had a bumper crop of highlights.  

## Overall Highlights  

First of all, I was able to collaborate with [Jessica Critten](http://jessicacritten.com/), [Karen Nicholson](https://twitter.com/nicholsonkp), and [Eamon Tewell](http://eamontewell.com/) on our praxis session, "Critical Information Literacy as Collaborative Praxis." I'd met them all before during the [#critlib chats](http://tinyurl.com/critlibx), but it was great actually work with them more at length. The "praxis session" format at CSA2015 involved a mix of a presentation and a set of discussion/workshop portions. It also turned out that there was more to the LIS contingent this year. I'll write more about that below!

Second of all, talking to the [FLOW (Feminist Library on Wheels)](http://feministlibraryonwheels.com/) and [Women's Center for Creative Work](http://womenscenterforcreativework.com/) during a panel in the conference [Makerspace](https://twitter.com/MakeSpaceTho) was quite inspiring.[^confmakr] The WCCW creators advocate creating "enabling architecture," a really compelling figure for talking about libraries and other infrastructures for thought, reflection, and action. Both of these projects embody the sort of Do-It-Ourselves/Do-It-Together/DIY impulse shared by many of my favorite library workers & favorite alternative art/music/infoshop spaces.

[^confmaker]: Yes, that's the second Makerspace I've been to in a conference, with the other being the equally fantastic [Collective](http://www.thelibrarycollective.org/) conference!  

Third, the ongoing discussions about the conference theme—"Another University is Possible"—consistently helped me reconsider our higher education practices.   

And I got to hear, among many others, Angela McRobbie, Fred Moten, and Jonathan Sterne! I also got to meet some  of the [FemTechNet]() leaders.  

## "Critical Information Literacy as Collaborative Praxis," You Say?  

"Praxis sessions" leapt out at me when I first saw the CFP for this year's conference. Having elsewhere witnessed panels at larger conferences that occasionally fail to gel into something cohesive (rather than people successively reading into the void), I appreciate the opportunity to learn along with each other. It's relieving to actually make scholarship a conversation. Getting to meet participants like Elizabeth Sarjeant from Simon Fraser University, [Chris Alen Sula](http://chrisalensula.org/), from Pratt Institute, and [Ivette Bayo Urban](http://bayoart.com) from the University of Washington makes conference sessions that much better. It was also nice to have a Library & Information Science contingent at the CSA.  

## Califas

Did I mention my love for Do-It-Ourselves & alternative spaces? On the way into Riverside, I got to visit [Slab City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_City) and [Salvation Mountain](http://www.salvationmountain.org/), both of which I highly recommend if you're in the area.

My old hangout, Back to the Grind, was also hosting one of the Saturation festival music/poetry/art events.
