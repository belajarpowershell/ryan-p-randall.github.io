## Lots of Linkage  

Here's a handful of links that I either shared or meant to share on Twitter:  

Rachael Neu linked to Richard Van Heertum's "How Objective is Objectivity?" article in [UCLA InterActions journal](http://escholarship.org/uc/search?entity=gseis_interactions;volume=1;issue=2) recently in a list-serv. I'm eagerly awaiting reading that article, but in the meanwhile wanted to share the link to the InterActions overall. It looks like a great, open access<i class="ai ai-open-access" aria-hidden="true"></i>, peer-reviewed LIS and education publication that focuses on information studies, not strictly information _science._ In other words, it's very much up my alley!   

Speaking of open access, I was very intrigued by Archambault, Côté, Struck, and Voorons' note [Research Impact of Paywalled versus Open Access Papers](http://www.1science.com/oanumbr.html).<i class="ai ai-open-access" aria-hidden="true"></i>  

I saw that the [Conference Proceedings of JITP 2010: The Politics of Open Source](http://scholarworks.umass.edu/jitpc2010/1/)<i class="ai ai-open-access" aria-hidden="true"></i> is online and open access. I found that while searching for a copy of John Sullivan's "Free, Open Source Software Advocacy as a Social Justice Movement: The Discourse of Digital Rights in the 21st Century" article, which I'm still very much looking forward to reading.  

Library Juice Press recently posted an interview with [Dr. Annie Downey, author of _Critical Information Literacy_](http://libraryjuicepress.com/blog/?p=5350). It's a great read and makes me look forward to getting <del>my grubby paws </del>my _strenuously professional hands_ on a copy of the book that I can annotate for my very own!  

Here's a fun [bread closing taxonomy](https://twitter.com/adzebill/status/759226657194516480). I hope to eventually work it into our information literacy for the sciences somehow.  

Tara Robertson and Jenna Freedman moderated a #critlib Twitter conversation on the [ethics of digitization](http://critlib.org/ethics-of-digitization/). I wasn't able to participate directly (only chiming in with a couple half-formed thoughts well afterward) but it looked great.  

## Comments Have Arrived  

I've long wanted to add comments to the site without making people sign up for _yet another_ service, as is required by most ways of adding comments to static sites (i.e. those made with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and similar site generators). So I was super excited when I saw that [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com) had added [Staticman](http://staticman.net) to the newest version of the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme! The present site is still running on a much older version, but I managed to get the comments working and he was kind enough to help me figure out how to make them display properly.  

You're very welcome to submit a comment. I will of course moderate them, which Staticman cleverly allows by making use of GitHub's branching feature. I'm excited by the prospect of this site becoming more collegial and interactive! [^tdr-sissy]  

[^tdr-sissy]: Simultaneously, I'm not above wielding the moderation hammer with all the wanton glee of the Designers Republic's [Sissy](http://thedesignersrepublic.bigcartel.com/product/sissy-poster-3d). Cheers!
