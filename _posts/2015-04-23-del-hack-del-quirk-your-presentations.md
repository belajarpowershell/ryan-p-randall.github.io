A new post of mine recently went [up at Hack Library School](http://hacklibschool.wordpress.com/2015/04/06/hack-quirk-your-demonstrations/). It's about a simple technique that I've noticed can help instruction sessions or resource demonstrations feel a bit more exciting and memorable: highlighting a quirky result or aspect of the interface.  

As a bonus, I talk about Batman, Wikipedia, and Google's simple Ngrams viewer!
