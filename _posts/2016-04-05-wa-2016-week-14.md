## Intro to #critlib chat  

Ray Maxwell suggested [#critLAM](). With my visual culture background, I'd prefer adding galleries and going with #critGLAM. Galleries, libraries, archives, and museums share an awful lot of overlap in terms of the critical questions we need to ask.  

## Revised my post on Reveal.js  

As a result of this #critlib chat, I went back and edited my [post on Reveal.js]({% post_url 2015-06-21-reveal-js-hack-library-school %}). More importantly, I also went back and added `alt` tags for the images in one of my most common [information literacy talks](http://www.ryanpatrickrandall.com/talks/cwi.html).  


_remove image tags if not a weekly assemblage post, Ryan_
