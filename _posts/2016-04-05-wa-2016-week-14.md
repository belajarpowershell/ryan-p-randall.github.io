## Intro to #critlib chat  

[Courtney Boudreau](https://about.me/courtums) hosted the second [intro to #critlib]() chat, having co-hosted [one earlier](http://critlib.org/intro-to-critlib-chat-part-1/) with Annie Pho. Here's a link to the [Storify](https://storify.com/AlicePrael/intro-to-critlib-part-2) made by Alice Prael.   

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A3. It would be cool to see <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/critlib?src=hash">#critlib</a> extend across all of LAM. Fascinating stuff is going on at museums and archives. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CritLAM?src=hash">#CritLAM</a>?</p>&mdash; Ray Maxwell (@hsifnihplod) <a href="https://twitter.com/hsifnihplod/status/717055960972439553">April 4, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>  

Among many other suggestions and insights throughout the chat, one by [Ray Maxwell](https://raymmaxx.wordpress.com) really caught my eye. He suggested [#critLAM](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CritLAM?src=hash)—a fantastic idea! With my visual culture background, I'd like to add "galleries" and go with #critGLAM. Galleries, libraries, archives, and museums share an awful lot of overlap in terms of the critical questions we need to ask about representation, marginalization, preservation, self-understanding, access, etc., etc., etc.  

## Revised my post on Reveal.js  

As a result of this #critlib chat, I went back and edited my [post on Reveal.js]({% post_url 2015-06-21-reveal-js-hack-library-school %}). More importantly, I also went back and added `alt` tags for the images in one of my most common [information literacy talks](http://www.ryanpatrickrandall.com/talks/cwi.html).  

## Makerspace stuff at Trailhead in Boise  

For First Thursday, our local open gallery walk thing in Boise, [Trailhead](https://trailheadboise.org) had their first-ever Maker's Showcase.   

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sonic Scarf. <a href="https://twitter.com/TrailheadBoise">@TrailheadBoise</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/boisemakers?src=hash">#boisemakers</a> <a href="https://t.co/G1KcZttuXd">pic.twitter.com/G1KcZttuXd</a></p>&mdash; amy vecchione (@librarythinking) <a href="https://twitter.com/librarythinking/status/718219540036001793">April 7, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>  

Unsurprisingly, the sound-makers caught my attention first. [Amy Vecchione]() showed off her cool Sonic Scarf, which had been so well-loved by the time I experienced it that the batteries seemed to have run low, so I couldn't hear it as well as I'd have liked.  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Executive Director Raino Zoller testing out the Plosiphone, an instrument invented by Scott Schmader <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/makershowcase?src=hash">#makershowcase</a> <a href="https://t.co/KurLCYx7Gl">pic.twitter.com/KurLCYx7Gl</a></p>&mdash; Trailhead (@TrailheadBoise) <a href="https://twitter.com/TrailheadBoise/status/718218094955610113">April 7, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

A BSU student named Scott Schmader—the head of BSU's Creative Technologies Association, a Maker student group—showed off his Plosiphone and let at least a few other folks test it out.   

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/makerbot">@makerbot</a> This was my first 3D printed model of a design on which I had worked, to help teach stats <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/makermilestones?src=hash">#makermilestones</a> <a href="https://t.co/1rB9Xy6bSR">pic.twitter.com/1rB9Xy6bSR</a></p>&mdash; Donovan Kay (@DonovanKayyy) <a href="https://twitter.com/DonovanKayyy/status/718508778325344256">April 8, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>  

I was perhaps most impressed by Donovan Kay's use of 3D printing to make statistics more readily accessible to people with vision impairments. He showed off a few iterations of his attempt to make standard deviations tangible to blind students.
