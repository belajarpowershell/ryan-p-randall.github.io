Over the weekend, I wrote a note with a short list of the [Obsidian plugins]({% link _notes/Note-taking/Obsidian/obsidian-plugins.md %}) that do the most to make it feel like "my" notes.  

I'm already planning to detail some of these further in separate notes. If that's somehow your sort of preferred reading, stay tuned!
