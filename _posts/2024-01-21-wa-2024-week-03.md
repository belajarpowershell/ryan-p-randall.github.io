## Sound of the Week  

Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip… That's thankfully not the sound of [the tap or our kitchen sink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NERzLlHo-D0), but instead the snow melting everywhere in Boise this weekend. I measured at least 8 inches / 20.3 centimeters on the ground, and that was after an overnight rain that probably helped compact some of it. This is a **lot** of snow for Boise… the second most on the ground I can remember in all our years here!  

## Viewing and Reading  

This week we watched the end of _Star Trek: Voyager_ and, a few days later, started into _Star Trek: Enterprise._ We're also mixing in _Derry Girls_ and _Star Trek: Prodigy_, re-watching the episodes we've already seen to get back up to the portions that are new to us.  

Now that our "Viewing Alpha"[^fnma] has gone beyond what initially aired before Constance Penley wrote [_NASA/Trek_](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2649214W/NASA_Trek?edition=key%3A/books/OL665281M) ([publisher site](https://www.versobooks.com/products/1578-nasa-trek)), I think I might finally read my copy, too.  

Otherwise, I've really been enjoying Maurice Lee's _[[lee overwhelmed|Overwhelmed]]_.  

[^fnma]: For those not yet of the Trek persuasion, this is a reference to [Memory Alpha](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Memory_Alpha:Introduction), a fan wiki whose name refers to [Memory Alpha](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Memory_Alpha), effectively an archival "memory planet."  

## Lightly-Annotated Linkapalooza  

- In [Incrementally correct personal websites](https://brianlovin.com/writing/incrementally-correct-personal-websites), Brian Lovin discusses both the idea of "iterating toward something more truthful, accurate, usable, or interesting" and how he applies that to his own site.  
- In [Let a website be a worry stone.](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/), Ethan Marcotte writes about his site in a way that sounds quite familiar to me.  
- [Color Safe](http://colorsafe.co/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/donnieberg/accessible-color-palette)) lets you quickly choose lovely **and** accessible color palettes based on the WCAG Guidelines for color contrast ratios.  
- On his [How to Canvas site](https://www.howtocanvas.com/) Dr. Sean Nufer provides many tutorials and workable code templates for the Canvas learning management system.  
- In [Exploring AI Pedagogy](https://exploringaipedagogy.hcommons.org/), maintained by the [MLA-CCCC Joint Task Force on Writing and AI](https://exploringaipedagogy.hcommons.org/about/), instructors share their teaching reflections related to generative "AI."  

## TWI(R)L  

This week I (re)learned about…

- [The ELIZA effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect), which seems mighty relevant to how people attribute cognition, emotion, or interiority to so-called "artificial intelligence" software.  
- [The ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/), which explains both patterns and practices to make more accessible web experiences.  
- ["influenza" etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza#Etymology), including "influenza di stelle" or "influence of the stars."  

## Site Refinements of the Week  

- I modified the [backlinks plugin](https://github.com/ryan-p-randall/ryan-p-randall.github.io/blob/develop/_plugins/bidirectional_links_generator.rb) so that double-bracket (wikilink-style) links will work for blog posts, not just notes.  
- I added the "Bonus Info" section to all the blog posts, which is where these backlinks will show up. You can also link to any page revisions or take a gander at the page source, too.  
- I added `aria-label="Breadcrumbs` and `aria-current="page"` to my breadcrumbs include, as suggested by the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/breadcrumb/examples/breadcrumb/).  
- I'm also refining the structure of these "weekly assemblage" notes to be a little more skimmable, and less likely to lead me toward bundling up a bunch of things that might better be published as smaller, separate posts.  
- I updated the CSS a bit.
