[Weekly Whaaaâ€¦?]({% post_url 2016-01-09-weekly-whaaa %})  
{: .notice}  

This week I've mostly been re-reading and/or finishing a couple of books I've been plodding along with for years: Chantal Mouffe's [_Agonistics:_]() and Lawrence Grossberg's [_Bringing It All Back Home_]().    

_remove image tags if not a weekly assemblage post, Ryan_

_add an excerpt before posting_
