## This Is Halloween 

A couple of the CWI Library student workers suggested [*Once Upon a Time*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_(TV_series)) as a theme for our Halloween decorations, and we ended up embracing it enthusiastically.  I admittedly had to do some *ahem* "binge watching research" on Netflix, but our approach to the theme said that any fairy tale character would be fair game. I decided to go with Hook, even though I'm just now getting to his character's introduction in the show. 

Here's the photo from Halloween day in the library: 

<div id="fb-root"></div><script>(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script><div class="fb-post" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/CWILibrary/posts/919061274843143:0" data-width="500"><div class="fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"><blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/CWILibrary/photos/a.173016252780986.43002.154768854605726/919061274843143/?type=3"><p>Day 2 in the Enchanted Forest at the Nampa Library.

And here's a set of photos of library decorations (which I intentionally took without patrons): 

<div id="fb-root"></div><script>(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script><div class="fb-post" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/CWILibrary/posts/919142651501672" data-width="500"><div class="fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"><blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/CWILibrary/posts/919142651501672"><p>If you haven&#039;t had a chance to see the Enchanted Forest yet, here&#039;s what you&#039;ve been missing.

Most of our students seem to have Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday schedules, so we chose to start dressing up on Wednesday. This meant that I got to teach my first library resources instruction session as Hook! It seemed to go rather well. We also did CWI's Trunk or Treat, bringing a game of bag toss (that's "corn hole" for you Midwesterners) that the children used steadily for a few hours.   

## Readings for This Month  

Now that the move has mostly settled down, here's a few things I'm hoping to read in the next month or so:  

- Chantal Mouffe's [*Agonistics: Thinking the World Politically*](https://www.worldcat.org/title/agonistics-thinking-the-world-politically/oclc/813931637)  
- Dee Garrison's [*Apostles of Culture: The Public Librarian and American Society, 1876-1920*](https://www.worldcat.org/title/apostles-of-culture-the-public-librarian-and-american-society-1876-1920/oclc/4529934)  
- Geoffrey C. Bowker's [*Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences*](https://www.worldcat.org/title/sorting-things-out-classification-and-its-consequences/oclc/878583923)  

We'll see how rapidly I get through them, but I'm hoping to be able to chat about these soon enough since I've heard them praised or referenced repeatedly.
