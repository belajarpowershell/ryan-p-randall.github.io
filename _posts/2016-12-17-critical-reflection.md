I really appreciate Lisa Hubbell's commitment to making this chat about critical reflection more accessible to people for whom Twitter isn't optimal. The topic itself seems to beg for a different kind of engagement, to boot.   

I like prompts. I like tools for thinking. I'm trying to make more of them for the students at my college, since I believe that kind of externalization helps for recall and thus for learning/training.  

Here are the things I often ask:  
who, what, when, where, why, and how  
Here's a few more that I've added to those:  
for whom, in what ways, and under what conditions?  

Getting Things Done suggests reflection and uses some metaphors that have helped me in the past (different "levels" of perspective)  

David Seah's various [productivity tools](http://davidseah.com/productivity-tools/) profoundly help reinforce a practice of reflection. Unlike a lot of people who write about productivity, his site and tools don't trip my spidey sense for boosterism or selling things. He gives the documents away as free downloads! (He does sell pre-printed ones as well.) Instead, between his explanations of the various tools and his own blog about things like his ["groundhog resolutions"](http://davidseah.com/tag/ghdr/), he seems very committed to the idea that review is a (maybe _the?_) path to progress.   

My mind is usually running, often reflecting too much in a way that's not productiveâ€”it's more argumentative or defensive. But physical activity often helps me get into a slightly different, more openly reflective mindset. Things that have helped me include: skateboarding, running, hackey sack, kempo, yoga, hiking, biking, tai chi, and sometimes just letting my leg do that weird sewing machine leg thing.
