<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>A newly-minted graduate of <a href="http://www.soic.indiana.edu/graduate/degrees/information-library-science/master-library-science/">IU Bloomington's ALA-Accredited MLS program</a>, I'm focusing on instruction and outreach librarianship. My courses at IU emphasized critical information literacy, humanities subject librarianship, and digital humanities.</p> 

<p>I worked with two different titles at the <a href="http://www.libraries.iub.edu/index.php?pageId=285">Government Information, Maps, and Microform Services Department</a> of IU Bloomingtonâ€™s <a href="http://www.libraries.iub.edu/index.php?pageId=89">Herman B Wells Library</a> while working toward my MLS. In my second year I worked as the Government Information Reference Assistant, providing critical information literacy instruction as I helped patrons discover and access resources at the combination reference/circulation desk. My first year, I worked as the Maps Graduate Assistant in the same department, carefully scanning maps, determining appropriate metadata, and making these historical resources available online through the <a href="http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/images/splash.htm?scope=images/VAC3073">Indiana Historical Maps Digital Collection</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of that department, I worked with Carrie Donovan as a library Instruction Assistant. I also assisted Andrew Asher, IU's Assessment Librarian, in conducting ethnographic studies of library patrons.</p>

<p>Prior to librarianship, I picked up an MA in <a href="http://english.ucr.edu/">English from the University of California, Riverside</a> and an MA in <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/college/vcs/">Visual and Cultural Studies from the University of Rochester</a>. As a graduate student in the humanities, I taught what librarians call information literacy skills while being the instructor for many first-year seminar courses or similar lower-division American Studies and Film/Media courses. I have also been a college writing tutor for undergraduate and graduate students.</p>

<p>I am currently refining my critical information literacy instruction skills, learning more digital humanities techniques, and building a librarianship based on critical praxis.</p>
