<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Currently working as the Government Information Reference Assistant in the <a href="http://www.libraries.iub.edu/index.php?pageId=285">Government Information, Maps, and Microform Services Department</a> of IU Bloomington’s <a href="http://www.libraries.iub.edu/index.php?pageId=89">Herman B Wells Library</a>, I’m excited to provide critical information literacy instruction as I help patrons discover and access resources at the combination reference/circulation desk. Last year I worked as the Maps Graduate Assistant in the same department, carefully scanning maps, determining appropriate metadata, and making these historical resources available online through the <a href="http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/images/splash.htm?scope=images/VAC3073">Indiana Historical Maps Digital Collection</a>.  </p>

<p>Outside of that department, I’m working as a library Instruction Assistant and helping the Assessment Librarian conduct ethnographic studies of library patrons. In the past, I’ve taught Freshman writing, American Studies, and Film/Media courses. I have also been a college writing tutor for undergraduate and graduate students.  </p>

<p>Along the way, I’ve picked up an MA in <a href="http://english.ucr.edu/">English from the University of California, Riverside</a> and an MA in <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/college/vcs/">Visual and Cultural Studies from the University of Rochester</a>. As a student in IU Bloomington’s <a href="http://ils.indiana.edu/">MLS program</a> I am refining my critical information literacy instruction skills, learning digital humanities techniques, and building a librarianship based on critical praxis. </p>
