Of all the various types of critical theory, I identify most closely with cultural studies.  

## Some of My Favorite Books on Critical Theories 

- [_Bringing It All Back Home: Essays On Cultural Studies_](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/916066759), Lawrence Grossberg, 1997  
  
- [_May '68 and Its Afterlives_](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48263748), Kristin Ross, 2002  
  
- [_Agonistics: Thinking the World Politically_](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/813931637), Chantal Mouffe, 2013   
  
- [_Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Toward a Radical Democratic   Politics_](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/886808969), Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, 2001, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed.  
  
- [_The Modern Invention of Information_](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/231881313), Ronald E. Day, 2001

## Some of My Favorite Articles on Critical Theories  

- ["Connecting with the Cosmic: Arthur Russell, Rhizomatic Musicianship, 
and the Downtown Music Scene, 1973-92"](http://liminalities.net/3-3/index.htm), Tim Lawrence, 2007, _Liminalities: A Journal of Performance Studies_   
  
On top of being about disco and downtown NYC art music, this article made me stop judging Deleuze & Guattari based on their fanboys and instead appreciate how assemblage theory can help us avoid adopting Great Men approaches to history. Lawrence also writes superbly, even when harnessing academic language. _And_ he's considerate enough to have put this in [_Liminalities: A Journal of Performance Studies_](http://liminalities.net/edpolicy.htm), an open access, peer-reviewed journal.  
  
- ["'What Do We Want?' 'Materiality!' 'When Do We Want It?' 'Now!'"](http://sterneworks.org/Sterne--Materiality.pdf), Jonathan Sterne, 2014, _Media Technologies: Essays on Communication, Materiality and Society_, eds. Tarleton Gillespie, Kirsten Foote and Pablo Boczkowski  
  
Jonathan Sterne writes, thinks, and speaks wonderfully. Check out his [repository](http://sterneworks.org/text/) as well as his [blog](http://superbon.net/). You'll find some other great stuff like ["Keyword: Journal"](http://sterneworks.org/keywordjournal.pdf), ["Pedagogy of the Job Market"](http://sterneworks.org/pedagogyofthejobmarket.pdf), and ["Communication as Techné"](http://sterneworks.org/Sterne-CommunicationAsTechne.pdf), not to mention an entire page stuffed full of [advice for those venturing into academe](http://sterneworks.org/academe/). Can you imagine a world where all scholars and thinkers were routinely this generous?   
  
- ["Agent of Change: An Interview with bell hooks"](http://www.tricycle.com/special-section/agent-change-interview-bell-hooks), bell hooks, 1992, interviewed by Helen Tworkov for _Tricycle_  
  
- ["Cultural Studies and its Theoretical Legacies"](https://msuweb.montclair.edu/~furrg/pursuits/hallcultstuds.html), Stuart Hall, 1992, _Cultural Studies_, ed. Lawrence Grossberg, Cary Nelson, Paula Treichler  
  
- ["Queering the Catalog: Queer Theory and the Politics of Correction"](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/669547), Emily Drabinski, 2013, _The Library Quarterly_  
  
- ["Library as Infrastructure"](https://placesjournal.org/article/library-as-infrastructure/), Shannon Mattern, 2014, _Places Journal_

- "Cultural Studies: What's In a Name? (One More Time)", Lawrence Grossberg, 1995, anthologized in [_Bringing It All Back Home: Essays On Cultural Studies_](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/916066759), Lawrence Grossberg, 1997  

It's unfortunate that this reading isn't more widely accessible—although he does touch on a lot of similar topics in a few of the many articles he has on [Academia.edu](https://unc.academia.edu/LawrenceGrossberg), which I feel vaguely dirty even linking to since it's far from a substitute for an actual institutional repository.   

Across this and some similar essays ("Wandering Audiences, Nomadic Critics," "Cultural Studies and/in New Worlds," "The Formations of Cultural Studies: An American in Birmingham," "On the Political Responsibilities of Cultural Studies," & "History, Politics, and Postmodernism: Stuart Hall and cultural studies")[^ideologycommunication] Grossberg does a stellar job of showing how cultural studies has evolved from a group of scholars primarily from working class backgrounds interested in adult education & labor concerns to a more intentionally decolonial, feminist, and queer undertaking. He does a great job of explaining Stuart Hall, Angela McRobbie, and other Cultural Studies touchstones, as well as showing how the cultural studies approach that he advocates for focuses on a materialist study of the effects of practices and how they are articulated, an approach that is simultaneously both anti-essentialist and not relativistic, basing a claim's truthfulness on its ability to give the thinker purchase on effects in the world.   

[^ideologycommunication]: I also really like Grossberg's "The Ideology of Communication: Post-Structuralism and the Limits of Communication," which is on that non-IR site. It's definitely not an introductory reading, but it's a good one.
