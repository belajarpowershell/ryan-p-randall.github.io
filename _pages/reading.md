I've occasionally kept track of what I'm reading on BookWyrm, Goodreads, or similar sites.  

As an ongoing experiment with centralizing things to this site, I'm going to try doing so here as well / instead. I often read multiple books in parallel, so I plan to annotate my progress here.  

I plan to add links to reading notes in my digital garden once I'm done, as a type of review.
