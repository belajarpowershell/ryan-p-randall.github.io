Within librarianship, I mostly do instruction, outreach, and reference. As these are my most local and constant contexts, these practices inflect how I think of librarianship. It's unsurprising, therefore, that most of these articles have to do with those thingsâ€”but this connection certainly doesn't mean that I think critical librarianship only exists within these contexts!  

I'll link to things beyond these contexts as well, when I read ones that excite me. Of course, I'd love for you to write a list like this that focuses on your own approaches to librarianship.
