> A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.  

## Testing **Placeholder** Text for _Form_ Fields

- testing *italic fonts* as well  
- testing **bold fonts** as well  
- testing ***italic bold fonts*** for sure  

### `Placeholder` Test

<label for="text">Submission Instructions:</label>

<input type="text" id="text" name="text" placeholder="Does this text automagically disappear?" required>

The above text uses the `placeholder` html attribute.  
It offers a suggestion or example that will disappear when other text is entered.

### `Value` Test

<label for="text">Submission Instructions:</label>

<input type="text" id="text" name="text" value="Does this text automagically disappear?" required>

The above text uses the `value` html attribute.  
It prepopulates the field with that text.
