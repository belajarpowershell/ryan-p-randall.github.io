## What I'm Doing Currently  

Here are some of the things I'm currently doing, as of Summer 2020:  

- Staying home as much as I can & wearing a mask whenever I can't. In entirely related news, I'm also re-learning how to cut my own hair. üíà‚úÇÔ∏è  
- Developing [InfoLit for Everyone](https://infolit-idaho.github.io/infolit-for-everyone/about/) with a [wonderful crew](https://www1.rebus.community/#/project/379f6355-8f50-4b7f-9408-ab88cb3eafd5) of other Idaho library & education workers. I'm grateful to also be learning from the fantastic people behind the [Rebus Textbook Success Program](https://www.rebus.community/c/textbook-success-program/120) as part of doing this!  
- Putting together my qualifying exam lists for my Ph.D. I'm stoked about getting to work with my committee members & excited about my topic, so I'll probably be sharing lots more about that on here soon.  
- Related to the above, I'm revamping some bits of this site.  
  - First, I'm starting to do some monthly posts I'm calling ["signal boosts"]({% post_url 2020-07-01-introducing-monthly-signal-boosts %}), largely inspired by [Jessica Schomberg's Monthly Reading Lists](https://schomj.weebly.com).  
  - Second, I'm considering how to add some sort of [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) or wonky wiki for my research, since my previous attempt at maintaining a separate [Research Notebook](http://www.ryanpatrickrandall.com/research-notebook/) always felt too formal (and technically duplicative / clumsy), when what I was hoping for was trying to [work with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu). I'm trying to decide between adapting [Tom Critchlow's folder-based model](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/) or [Mike Tannenbaum's liquid-based version](https://mind.miketannenbaum.com) of [Maxime Vaillancourt's theme](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll).  
- And absolutely saving the best for last: getting married! üéâ‚ÄºÔ∏è Instead of postponing until our family & friends could be here in person, we got married in our backyard. Two of our best friends were there, one to officiate & the other to juggle some of the tech aspects of streaming it to our attendees.
