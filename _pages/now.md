## What I'm Doing Currently  

Here are some of the things I'm currently doing, as of Summer 2022. Not a ton has changed since Summer 2020, both for better and for worse.  

- The biggest thing is switching from working as a librarian to working as an instructional designer for online courses. While this seems to be a big change to other people, I mostly feel continued concerns:  
    - how is information shared?  
    - how can these documents or interfaces be improved?  
    - how can we save the time of the learner?  
    - what does research (and affected communities) say about making this more accessibile to the widest possible set of learners?  
    - which needs and communities are being left out, and how can we remedy that?  
- I'm quite happy to be growing far more familiar with the [Quality Matters rubric](https://www.qualitymatters.org/qa-resources/rubric-standards/higher-ed-rubric) and the [Universal Design for Learning](https://www.cast.org/impact/universal-design-for-learning-udl) framework.  
- Just as I was in Summer 2022, I'm staying home as much as I can‚Äîand I'm getting things curbside and wearing a mask whenever I can't. In entirely related news, I'm slowly getting better at cutting my own hair. üíà‚úÇÔ∏è  
- I'm also still putting together my qualifying exam lists for my Ph.D.  
- After lots of experimentation, I've worked out how I'll do a [digital garden](https://www.ryanpatrickrandall.com/notes/) using Jekyll for now.  
- I'm enjoying the free, open-source notetaking tool [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) so much that I donate to its ongoing development each month, as well as volunteering as part of its supportive user community. I'm also writing [notes about how I use it](https://www.ryanpatrickrandall.com/notes/Note-taking/Dendron/beginning-to-use-dendron)!  
- Watching _Deep Space Nine_ for the first time, occasionally wondering how I went without watching the series for so long, and realizing that line of thought isn't a very "now" approach, now is it?
