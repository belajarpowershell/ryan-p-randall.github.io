## What I'm Doing Currently  

Here's some of what I'm currently doing, as of Summer 2023.  
- I'm re-learning Spanish as part of my Ph.D. program requirements. I haven't formally used Spanish since junior year of high school… back when Tupac was still alive. Since then I've studied Latin for my undergrad program, and then French (for reading purposes only) for my English MA program. Between those, I'm able to get the gist of most Romance languages. I'm definitely stoked to be re-learning Spanish, though! Maybe I'll end up reading some of Manuel Castells' works for the dissertation project, or other academic things, in addition to just being closer to verbally fluent again?  
- I'm still using the free, open-source notetaking tool [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/), even though it's moved from active development to primarily being in a "maintenance mode." I've got my eye on Obsidian, should I ever need to switch, but I've decided that I like Dendron and VS Code enough that I'm not going to move until something makes me do so.  
- Continuing my first viewing of _Star Trek_. We started with _Deep Space Nine_, then went to the original series, and have continued watching all the series and movies in order. At this point we're up to the first season of _Voyager._
