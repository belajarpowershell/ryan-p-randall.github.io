<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Currently working as the Maps Graduate Assistant in the <a href="http://www.libraries.iub.edu/index.php?pageId=285">Government Information, Maps, and Multiform Services</a> department of IU-Bloomington’s <a href="http://www.libraries.iub.edu/index.php?pageId=89">Herman B. Wells Library</a>, I’m excited to help make these historical resources available digitally through the <a href="http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/images/splash.htm?scope=images/VAC3073">Indiana Historical Maps Digital Collection</a>. It’s a lot of careful scanning and considering appropriate descriptive metadata for different uses of the map images—as well as lot of fun when I have my shifts on the reference desk.  </p>

<p>I’m also working as an Instruction Assistant and helping with a couple of ethnographic studies we’re doing of various library patrons. In the past, I’ve taught Freshman writing courses, American studies, and Film/Media courses, as well as been a college writing tutor for undergraduates and graduate students.   </p>

<p>Along the way, I’ve picked up an MA in <a href="http://english.ucr.edu/">English from the University of California, Riverside</a> and an MA in <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/college/vcs/">Visual and Cultural Studies from the University of Rochester</a>. IU-Bloomington’s <a href="http://ils.indiana.edu/">MLS program</a> keeps me busy figuring out how to continue doing instruction and research from a different perspective.  </p>
