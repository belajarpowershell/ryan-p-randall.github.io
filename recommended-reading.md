This page is still _very much_ under construction. I'm inspired by [April Hathcock's](https://aprilhathcock.wordpress.com/recommended-reading/) and [Jessica Schomberg's](http://catassessmentresearch.blogspot.com/2016/02/critlib-and-diversity-related-books.html) lists and want to share something similar. I plan to have a range of things here, eventually including links to my own posts that deal with cultural studies & critical theory, particularly as it pertains to LIS. I'm also planning to organize and annotate these recommendations more along the way.

### Articles  
  
#### More towards Cultural Studies / Critical Theory  

"Cultural Studies: What's In a Name? (One More Time)", Lawrence Grossberg, 1995, anthologized in [_Bringing It All Back Home: Essays On Cultural Studies_](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/916066759), Lawrence Grossberg, 1997  
  
["Connecting with the Cosmic: Arthur Russell, Rhizomatic Musicianship, 
and the Downtown Music Scene, 1973-92"](http://liminalities.net/3-3/index.htm), Tim Lawrence, 2007, _Liminalities: A Journal of Performance Studies_  
  
On top of being about disco and downtown NYC art music, this article made me stop judging Deleuze & Guattari based on their fanboys and instead appreciate how assemblage theory can help us avoid adopting Great Men approaches to history. Lawrence also writes superbly, even when harnessing academic language. _And_ he's considerate enough to have put this in [_Liminalities: A Journal of Performance Studies_](http://liminalities.net/edpolicy.htm), an open access, peer-reviewed journal.  
  
["'What Do We Want?' 'Materiality!' 'When Do We Want It?' 'Now!'"](http://sterneworks.org/Sterne--Materiality.pdf), Jonathan Sterne, 2014, _Media Technologies: Essays on Communication, Materiality and Society_, eds. Tarleton Gillespie, Kirsten Foote and Pablo Boczkowski  
  
Jonathan Sterne writes, thinks, and speaks wonderfully. Check out his [repository](http://sterneworks.org/text/) as well as his [blog](http://superbon.net/). You'll find some other great stuff like ["Keyword: Journal"](http://sterneworks.org/keywordjournal.pdf), ["Pedagogy of the Job Market"](http://sterneworks.org/pedagogyofthejobmarket.pdf), and ["Communication as Techn√©"](http://sterneworks.org/Sterne-CommunicationAsTechne.pdf), not to mention an entire page stuffed full of [advice for those venturing into academe](http://sterneworks.org/academe/). Can you imagine a world where all scholars and thinkers were routinely this generous?
