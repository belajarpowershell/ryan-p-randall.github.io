This is a first test of the new `_notes` garden.  

Will it link to [[a second test]] note?  

## H2  

What will a regular link to something like [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) look like?  

## H2.1  

Here is a [[a second test]].  
And here is [[a third test]].  

But what about [[a different thing 01]]?  

And perhaps I mention [[literature notes in Dendron]]?
