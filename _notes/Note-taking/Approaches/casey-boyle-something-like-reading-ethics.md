This strategy for reading is meant to build better habits of reading, as well as better note-taking. It's a nice complement to a [[rhetorical-precis]], but more open-ended.  

## Casey Boyle's "…something like a reading ethics…"  

Casey's [post on his approach](https://web.archive.org/web/20161026154722/https://caseyboyle.net/2016/01/16/something-like-a-reading-ethics/) (via the WaybackMachine) explains it in excellent detail. It's very much worth reading in full.  

Here's just the brief summary he provides, both for reading and note-taking:  

### Reading  

1. Skim through the work noting the title, chapter, subtitles, indices, etc.
2. Read the introduction & conclusion
3. Fill in the rest by reading through the work

### Note-Taking  

1. Exigence (identify the writer’s articulation of the exigence)
2. Response (identify what the writer is bringing in response to exigence). 
3. Key Terms/Words (locate the key terms and concepts)
4. Key Citations (3-4 key citations the work relies on)
5. Questions (understanding and critique)
6. Speculative Response (speculate how a writer might respond to Questions in Step 5).
