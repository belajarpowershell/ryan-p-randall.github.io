## What is Dendron?  

[Dendron](https://wiki.dendron.so/) lets you create—and more importantly, organize—plain text notes in VS Code. It not only lets you link between notes like a wiki, it makes notes findable through a tree view and customizable, hierarchical organization.  

I'm such a fan that I switched from Atom to VS Code as my main text editor, happily donate a few dollars a month to support its open-source development, and volunteer as a [Dendrologist](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/0QQNklzyOweaOez8E7iTX/), helping answer questions and refine documentation.  

Before using Dendron, I've long taken notes in Markdown, and I'm familiar with making websites using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). These experiences make Dendron more intuitive for me than it might be for many new users.  

So here are a few starting points that might make starting out with Dendron easier for you.  

## Starting Points  

Kevin and Jonathan [presented on Dendron](https://youtu.be/dW6m4_O0qvQ) to VS Code's developer community. This video provides a good overview of what the tool looks like, so you can quickly see if it might suit how you like to work.  

Ian Jones has made a [short, free guide](https://egghead.io/lessons/vs-code-download-and-install-a-dendron-workspace) on Egghead.io with video instructions to walk you through installing VS Code, installing the Dendron extension, and setting it up for the first time.  

Here's Dendron's own [Getting Started Guide](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/678c77d9-ef2c-4537-97b5-64556d6337f1/), which is a combo of text and short videos in their wiki.  

Bryan Jenks has made a [robust video introduction](https://youtu.be/nfvx8rv77NA), which covers many of the details.
