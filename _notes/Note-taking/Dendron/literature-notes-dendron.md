I've been refining a system for taking literature notes in [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/), which complements keeping citations with [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). My systems remain perpetually in flux, but this is at least my most current *write-up*, if not my most current approach.  

As of 2021-06-21, I haven't written notes about Dendron or Zotero. In brief:  
- Dendron is an extension for the text editor VS Code. If you prefer a "what you see is what you get" tool, you might prefer an note-taking alternative like Obsidian. But if you appreciate the extensibility and customization enabled through VS Code's vast set of extensions, Dendron's the best note-taking tool I've seen yet.  
- Zotero is a free citation manager. Although I've used alternatives years ago, I can't imagine ever moving away from Zotero.  

## Literature Notes  

What's a literature note? SÃ¶nke Ahrens, the author of [_How to Take Smart Notes_](https://takesmartnotes.com/) suggests splitting your references and your notes. He actually suggests a few levels of notes:  
1. Fleeting notes: records of your thoughts written anywhere that's ready-to-hand; you'll go through these later to see what's worth putting into a more permanent system  
2. Literature notes: very short, selective notes about what you read, primarily in your own words. He suggests keeping these, along with the bibliographic information, in a single place.  
3. Permanent notes: longer notes written as a method of processing your fleeting notes & your literature notes, with an eye toward your own purposes.  

Ahrens suggests making links between permanent notes, which is something Dendron is designed to do.  

## Dendron's Structure  

I plan to write more about structuing these literature notes in Dendron.
