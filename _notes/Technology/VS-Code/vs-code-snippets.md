I'm a fan of keeping a Bullet Journal in a text editor, as I've written about in [[task-tracking-in-dendron]].  

A Digital Bullet Journal might not seem like a very straightforward approach, but here's a non-exhaustive list of things I like about it:  

- it's more customizable than most dedicated Bullet Journal or GTD programs  
- the files involved (text or Markdown) are about as small and durable as computer files can be  
- it's relatively distraction-free  

## Context and Syntax  

Snippets are a substantial part of this customization. I use quite a few snippets in VS Code, both for bullet journal / daily log sort of things and HTML / CSS patterns. They allow both for quickly including repetitive patterns and for automatically including things like [dates or times](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_variables). There are [more advanced possibilities](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_snippet-syntax), too, but I haven't really explored those yet.  

### Snippet Considerations  

Probably the most difficult thing about using snippets isn't realizing where you can use them or even setting them up in your text editors or system-level keyboard settings; it's figuring out which prefixes and shortcodes to use as the expansion pattern. For the last few years, I've settled on usually using a semicolon followed immediately by a memorable abbreviation. I can't think of a time in natural language when I'd write a semicolon without a space after it, so it's served well as a pattern for invoking these kind of snippets. The `;` also is availably right under my pinky on a physical keyboard, and usually is on the primary or occasionally secondary level of a mobile device's digital keyboard as well.  

I still occasionally have the muscle memory of using a strudel (a `@`, which you might call an "at sign" if you're not of the pastry persuasion), so I've set up a number of these snippets to allow multiple invocation patterns. If you're going to use wizardry, do so inclusively!  

### VS Code Snippet Syntax  

You can store snippets in VS Code in a number of different places. For my purposes, it's so far been sufficient to use a [global snippets file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_create-your-own-snippets) and add the few languages in scope. That way I don't have to remember to add each pattern for each new language I start using. I can just keep a single file and occasionally add any new language to the snippet's [scope](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_snippet-scope) as desired.  

Here's my basic pattern for a snippet, with comments added after `//`:  
```json
"snippet name": { // I usually use the output, i.e. `#;done`
    "prefix": ["@dd", ";dd"], // the string(s) that will invoke the snippet
    "scope": "markdown,yaml", // the language(s) where the snippet will work, if you don't want it to work everywhere
    "description": "Add #;done", // just a note to you or others sharing your files
    "body": [ // the snippet pattern itself, with any new line on another new line
        "#;done",
    ],
}

```

## Bullet Journal / Task Management Snippets  

I keep a Digital Bullet Journal mostly based around weekly notes. I also use Dendron's tags, which start with `#` characters. As far as I can tell, most other Markdown-based tools I've tried out (like Zettlr or Obsidian) have similarly converged on using `@` for tagging people and `#` for tagging concepts.  

Here's a few of the snippets I've found very handy for this kind of DigiBuJo / text-file-based task management system.  

### `#;done`  

I've found that adding a tag indicating that I'm done with a particular day or task makes it much easier to scan files and reacquaint myself to what info is now just a record of the past and what info is still "live" or "in play." It helps when skimming using an outline view, when folding headings, or even just when opening a note and realizing that there's a `#;done` annotation on the first heading, indicating that the entire week is now just a log without anything that still needs my attention.  

However, just adding a `#done` string will rapidly make that tag unweildly; I don't foresee a frequent need to see quickly see every single day I've marked with that, unlike tags such as `#urgent` or `#reading`.  

Therefore, this snippet is a tag intentionally broken by an interrupting semicolon.  

```json
"#;done": {
    "prefix": ["@dd", ";dd"],
    "scope": "markdown,yaml",
    "description": "Add #;done",
    "body": [
        "#;done",
    ],
},
```

### `#;done;(YYYY-MM-DD)`  

When I have a note that has multiple tasks for a longer project, it's often useful to know not just that something's accomplished, but also **when** it was done. This snippet builds on the previous one with an automatic date annotation.  

```json
"#;done; + today's date": {
    "prefix": ["@dtd", ";dtd"],
    "scope": "markdown,yaml",
    "description": "Add #;done + today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format; altered from Taskpaper format for Dendron tags",
    "body": [
        "#;done;($CURRENT_YEAR-$CURRENT_MONTH-$CURRENT_DATE)",
    ],
},
```

### Today's Date  

VS Code's snippets include [many standard variables](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_variables), making it easy to use a snippet that remembers the date better than you might. Here' a snippet that will expand to the [ISO 8601 date format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)â€”more on that below the snippet itself.  

```json
"today's date": {
    "prefix": ["@td", ";td"],
//    "scope": "markdown,yaml,json,dendron",
    "description": "Add today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format",
    "body": [
        "$CURRENT_YEAR-$CURRENT_MONTH-$CURRENT_DATE",
    ],
},
```

ISO 8601, by the way, remains the date format for [discerning nerds](https://xkcd.com/1179/) largely because it lists values in largest to smallest time unit and therefore has the benefit of sorting files reliably.  

It's used, for instance, for [sorting posts in Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/), the generator I use for this very site. I **just now** typed `;td` to invoke the snippet below into the `last_modified_at` value for this page. That means that once I run Jekyll again, today's date (2023-04-01) will show up in various places on this page (which should be the top and bottom visible metadata sections of this note, unless I've changed the template for these pages since writing this).  

The scope line is commented out in this snippet, because I personally want this snippet available everywhere in VS Code. If you want to use it but prefer to narrow the places where it will work, you'd want to delete the `//` comment indicators at the beginning of that line, then list only the file formats where you want this snippet to work.  

For instance, if you only wanted it to work in markdown and html files, you'd want the whole snippet to instead read:  

```json
"today's date": {
    "prefix": ["@td", ";td"],
    "scope": "markdown,html",
    "description": "Add today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format",
    "body": [
        "$CURRENT_YEAR-$CURRENT_MONTH-$CURRENT_DATE",
    ],
},
```

### This Hour & Minute  

This snippet will add this hour and minute in 24 hour clock format. I use it often when tracking times or writing in [Dendron daily notes](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/ogIUqY5VDCJP28G3cAJhd/).  

```json
"this hour and minute": {
    "prefix": ["@thm", ";thm"],
    "scope": "markdown,yaml,json",
    "description": "Add this hour and minute in 24 hour clock format",
    "body": [
        "$CURRENT_HOUR:$CURRENT_MINUTE",
    ],
},
```

### Times Started and Ended  

Building on the above, this snippet is useful for tracking time. When used, it will look something like `{started(17:10), ended(17:35)}`, useful for pomodoros or other ways of time tracking.  

```json
"times started and ended": {
    "prefix": ["@tsae", ";tsae"],
    "scope": "markdown,yaml,dendron",
    "description": "Add section to track start and end times",
    "body": [
        "{started($1$CURRENT_HOUR:$CURRENT_MINUTE), ended($2)}",
    ],
},
```

## HTML / CSS Snippets  

### Tables 

Here's a few snippets related to making more [accessible HTML data tables](https://webaim.org/techniques/tables/data). Each of these includes row or column headers, `scope=col` or `scope=row` indicators, and captions.  

They also use the VS Code syntax for [tab stops](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_tabstops) and for escaping quotation marks.  

Tab stops use dollar signs followed by numbers, like `$1`. You indicate the first tab stop with a `$1`, the second with `$2`, and so on, then optionally indicate your snippet's "final" tab stop with a `$0`. As of 2023-03-26, I'm including final tab stops in these. As I continue using them, I may or may not decide that I'll remove those.  

The `"col"` or `"row"` part of the `scope=` attribute needs to include the quotation marks. But including a `"` in the snippet itself will confuse VS Code, as it will interpret the `"` as the end of that line! So to clarify things for these easily-confused robots, these snippets use `\` characters to escape those quotation marks. I could probably instead use single quotation marks, but decades of humanities writing in American English has apparently made double quotation marks a difficult habit to break.  

#### Accessible HTML Table  

Here's an HTML data table that doesn't use a `<thead>`.  

```json
"@table": {
    "scope": "markdown,html,yaml",
    "prefix": ["@tt", ";tt"],
    "description": "html table with caption",
    "body": [
        "<table>",
        "<caption>$1</caption>",
        "  <tr>",
        "    <th scope=\"col\">$2</th>",
        "      <td>$3</td>",
        "      <td>$4</td>",
        "  </tr>",
        "  <tr>",
        "    <th scope=\"row\">$5</th>",
        "      <td>$6</td>",
        "      <td>$0</td>",
        "  </tr>",
        "</table>",
    ],
},
```

#### Accessible HTML Table with a `<thead>`  

Here's an HTML data table that does use a `<thead>`.  

According to WebAIM's summary, a `<thead>` doesn't add or interfere with accessibility concerns. They are handy for styling (with CSS) or for printing out long tables to paper, where any `<thead>` or `<tfoot>` rows will repeat at the top or bottom of a printed page.  

```json
"@tableh": {
    "scope": "markdown,html,yaml",
    "prefix": ["@tth", ";tth"],
    "description": "html table with caption, thead, and tbody",
    "body": [
        "<table>",
        "<caption>$1</caption>",
        "<thead>",
        "  <tr>",
        "    <th scope=\"col\">$2</th>",
        "      <td>$3</td>",
        "      <td>$4</td>",
        "  </tr>",
        "</thead>",
        "<tbody>",
        "  <tr>",
        "    <th scope=\"row\">$5</th>",
        "      <td>$6</td>",
        "      <td>$0</td>",
        "  </tr>",
        "</tbody>",
        "</table>",
    ],
},
```

#### Accessible HTML Table Row  

Once you've got the structure in place for a table, you'll almost certainly want to add more rows. So here's a snippet for beginning a row. You'll need to add additional `<td></td>` indicators for each additional cell, but VS Code and most other text editors will make that pretty easy.  

```json
"@table-row": {
    "scope": "markdown,html,yaml",
    "prefix": ["@tr", ";tr"],
    "description": "html table row",
    "body": [
        "  <tr>",
        "    <th scope=\"row\">$1</th>",
        "      <td>$2</td>",
        "      <td>$0</td>",
        "  </tr>",
    ],
},
```

## Jekyll Snippets  

### Date, Time, and Offset  

If you're publishing more than one post a day in Jekyll, it's handy to indicate the specific time in the `date` value of each [post's front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/#predefined-variables-for-posts) metadata section. The time format Jekyll uses isn't difficult to remember, but it's also exactly the sort of thing I'd prefer to have robots do for me. Another perfect candidate for a snippet!  

The output looks like this: `2023-04-01T19:14:39-6:00`

```json
"date and time for jekyll": {
    "prefix": [";dtj"],
    "scope": "markdown,yaml,json",
    "description": "Add today's date, and this hour, minute, and second in 24 hour clock format, with 6 hour Boise timezone offset",
    "body": [
        "$CURRENT_YEAR-$CURRENT_MONTH-${CURRENT_DATE}T$CURRENT_HOUR:$CURRENT_MINUTE:$CURRENT_SECOND-6:00",
    ],
},
```

If you're paying close attention, you'll notice that one of those variable names is enclosed by curly brackets.  

Here's that variable, and the relevant section: `${CURRENT_DATE}T$CURRENT_HOUR`.  

Without the curly brackets, that part of the snippet would look like `$CURRENT_DATET$CURRENT_HOUR`. Written this way, VS Code would think you're asking for `$CURRENT_DATET`, a variable that doesn't exist.  

In that unhappy version, the output you'll get is: `2023-04-CURRENT_DATET19:24:52-6:00`. Bummer.  

Using the curly brackets tells VS Code that the letter T isn't part of the variable name. In this scenario, it also lets it be output without a preceding space.  

You don't have to enclose every variable's name in this way, but this works as a nice example of when you'd want to do so.
