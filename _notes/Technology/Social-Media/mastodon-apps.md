I've been using Mastodon for a while. Apparently at least since April of 2017&#8253;?!

I tend to use Mastodon on my phone at least as much as I do through a browser. At various times I've used Toot!, Metatext, Mast, Amaroq, and just a browser tab pinned to appear as its own "app."  

I **haven't** ever used the "official" Mastodon app, but I have repeatedly heard that it doesn't offer the full features of the web interface.  

So here's a list of apps I'd recommend, on iOS. I'm sorry, but I don't have an Android device, so I can't offer any recommendations there.  

## Toot!  

On iOS, by far my favorite app is [Toot! for Mastodon](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/toot/id1229021451?ls=1&mt=8).  

Here's some of what I love about it:  
- It works smoothly with multiple accounts.  
- It handles accessibility features like reading and adding image altText wonderfully.  
- It offers multiple light and dark modes.  
- It provides "subway map" connecting lines that make it far easier to perceive response chains.  
- It's made by someone who has used Mastodon for quite a while and understands a variety of use cases.  
- It doesn't collect any information as you use it or show you any ads.  
- It generally is delightful.  

Here's the [app's own Mastodon account](https://mastodon.social/@tootapp), if you'd like to follow it for updates.  

## Metatext  

As for free apps, my current preference is [Metatext](https://metabolist.org/).  

Here are the things I really like about it:  
- It handles multiple accounts well. (Although the interface could be clearer; one has to click on your own profile image in order to bring up the menu where you can click on "Accounts" to switch between your accounts.)  
- It has a dark theme, which is important for insomniac scrolling.  
- It easily displays alt text for images. (Press on an image and it will focus in a sort of "lightbox" modal that hides the rest of the post, exposing the alt text at the bottom of the screen somewhat like a caption.)  

If you're looking for a free Mastodon app, it's a great one to try out.
