This is for people who are interested in Mastodon and looking for tips to become more comfortable using it and finding people on it.
{: .notice }

There have been many, many "how to" articles written about Mastodon. So many that I figure it might be useful to curate a small list of the ones I find exceptionally useful.  

Here are some starting points, in no particular order:  
- Alana M. Vincent's [Mastodon Quick Start Guide for Humanities Scholars](https://hcommons.org/docs/mastodon-quick-start-guide-for-humanities-scholars/). Written by [Dr. Alana Vincent](https://hcommons.org/members/avincent/) and hosted on Humanities Commons, this covers a lot of useful ground in case things feel unfamiliar to you.  
- Danielle Navarro's [Everything I know about Mastodon](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-11-03_what-i-know-about-mastodon/) is written for data scientists but seems useful far beyond that. It's organized by questions, which is always a structuring device I find handy.  
- [Academics on Mastodon](https://nathanlesage.github.io/academics-on-mastodon/) provides a set of **opt-in** lists of people you might want to follow, organized by discipline. It also lists groups (relays that function somewhere between hashtags and list-servs), preprint bots, and communities by discipline. There are also a handful of other resources listed.
